Huddersfield man delivers medical supplies to Ukraine,Richard Dass says refugees fleeing Ukraine are sleeping on concrete floors in bus shelters.,Huddersfield man delivers medical supplies to Ukraine Published 57 minutes ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE RICHARD DASS Image caption Richard Dass has driven from Huddersfield to Ukraine with a motorhome full of medical supplies A man delivering medical supplies to Ukraine has said the refugee situation is a lot worse than he had imagined. Richard Dass 55 drove from Huddersfield to a hospital south of Lviv where a friend works as a doctor. He said medical staff cheered as he unloaded the supplies but described shocking scenes as he crossed in to western Ukraine from Slovakia. It\s like seeing hundreds and hundreds of homeless people not knowing what to do next he said. The refugee situation is a lot worse than I had thought. They\re sleeping on the concrete floor of the train stations and bus shelters on the way and all sorts of things. IMAGE SOURCE RICHARD DASS Image caption Richard Dass said medical staff cheered as he unloaded supplies He said after unloading his 25-year-old Mazda Bongo motorhome he was working to source vacuum therapy apparatus which surgeons use to pull together the wounds of severely injured bomb victims. The hospitals are just full. They were over the moon with all the stuff we brought but we need to get more he said. We got out some drawing-up needles and they were just cheering. But these vacuum therapy machines are absolutely vital. He said he also hopes to be able to take refugees back with him to a school house he is renovating in central Slovakia. While in Ukraine Mr Dass is staying with friends who have taken in a woman and her six-year-old son after they fled from Kharkiv. He said the boy was so traumatised by the experience he appeared to be in a trance. Somebody showed us a picture of their house but it\s a pile of rubble everything\s gone he said. He said hundreds of refugees were arriving from the east each day and the town had its first air raid warning on Saturday. We\ve not seen any planes but we\re told the planes are flying west. We were told there were two explosions near to the hospital where we went this morning but we haven\t had that confirmed. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook Twitter and Instagram.

Ukraine: Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan helps aid effort,"Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, MP for Tooting, says doctors in Ukraine fear a chemical attack.",Ukraine: Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan helps aid effort Published 5 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption The MP for Tooting has been speaking to doctors on the ground in Ukraine An MP has travelled to Ukraine to help assist with humanitarian aid in the country following Russias invasion. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan MP for Tooting travelled to Lviv in western Ukraine to work as a humanitarian doctor. The shadow cabinet minister for mental health said local doctors feared a chemical attack on civilians. It comes as Russian forces widen their attacks targeting several Ukraine cities that previously escaped the worst of the onslaught. The A&E doctor said she is helping non-governmental organisation (NGO) MedGlobal carry out a needs assessment in the country. Speaking to BBC Newsnight Dr Allin-Khan said: We\re seeing doctors around the whole of Ukraine who are having to step into areas they\ve never worked. We\re meeting family doctors and psychiatrists who are worried that they are not trained in mass casualty triage. We\re having nurses in the field trying to save the live of children. “It appears as though nothing is off limits it’s following the playbook from Syria where 900 doctors and nurses lost their lives.”  Labour MP Dr Rosena Allin-Khan tells #Newsnight why she’s decided to travel to Lviv to work as a humanitarian doctor@BBCYaldaHakim pic.twitter.com/v59qwC8leW — BBC Newsnight (@BBCNewsnight) March 11 2022 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter She continued the medical community feared a chemical attack against civilians and she was concerned about hospitals and medical workers being targeted. They think the same playbook that was used in Syria is going to be used here in Ukraine and there is an absolute devastating fear she said. It appears as though nothing is off limits again this is following the playbook we saw in Syria where 900 doctors and nurses lost their lives. On Wednesday three people died when Russian forces attacked the Mariupol hospital. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Three people including a child died when Russian forces struck a hospital on Wednesday The Labour MPs visit comes after Downing Street criticised Conservative Adam Holloway MP for Gravesham when he visited Ukraine earlier this month. When asked if she should be in Ukraine Dr Allin-Khan said she was there in her capacity as a humanitarian doctor and she was not here for political purposes. I am a mother I am a doctor... I am seeing other people lose their children and I just could not come with the organisation that is doing incredible work and that I\ve worked with for many years she said.]
