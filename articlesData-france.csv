Frances Wellburn suicide: Inquest told of gaps in care,"Frances Wellburn received no mental health support during the first lockdown, an inquest hears.",Frances Wellburn suicide: Inquest told of gaps in care Published 23 March Share IMAGE SOURCE FAMILY PHOTO Image caption Frances Wellburn was described as an independent and intelligent woman A former NHS manager who took her own life had received no formal mental health support for two months at the start of lockdown an inquest heard. Frances Wellburn 56 from Fulford York was being treated for a depressive illness and was found hanging at her home on 2 August 2020. An internal NHS trust report had found gaps in the care provided to her. The coroner said it was not possible to say whether they caused or contributed to her death. Giving a narrative conclusion assistant coroner Jonathan Leach described Ms Wellburn as an independent intelligent and resourceful woman. He said she had received treatment for mental health issues for several years but on 15 September 2019 she experienced a sudden and unexpected deterioration in her condition. She was admitted to Cross Lane Hospital in Scarborough and was diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms. After being discharged from hospital on 13 October 2019 Ms Wellburns care was provided by the community mental health team but contact ended when the UK entered lockdown in March 2020. Image caption Ms Wellburns sister Rebecca said she hoped the trust recognised more could have been done to support her recovery Speaking after the inquest Ms Wellburn\s sister Rebecca said the significant gaps in care seemed to be essential to understanding the events which led to her death. I hope the Tees Esk and Wear Valley NHS Foundation Trust] recognise that more could have been done to support Frances\ recovery and prevent her tragic suicide she said. The trust said it was deeply sorry for Ms Wellburn\s death. Elizabeth Moody director of nursing and governance said: We have worked hard to make improvements following our own review into Frances\s tragic death in 2020 she said. The inquest heard from Alison McGrath the nurse who compiled the review into the care provided. She highlighted no referral had been made to the early intervention in psychosis (EIP) programme which she said should have been made at the point the first episode of psychosis was suspected. However she added it was difficult to say what difference it would have made. BBC Action Line If you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visit the BBCs Action Line. The inquest heard Ms Wellburns health deteriorated and she was detained under the Mental Health Act after taking an overdose on 26 May. She remained in hospital until 25 June and was once again cared for by the community mental health team throughout July. She last spoke with her care coordinator on 27 July and her consultant psychiatrist on the 28 July. The coroner said they had agreed there was no need to escalate her care and that an assessment under the Mental Health Act was not required. On 2 August police responded to a call from her family who were concerned. North Yorkshire Police attended her home on Main Street in Fulford and found her body.

Danny France: Transgender teen who died fell into service 'black hole',Danny France's father says he remains concerned others might not get the help they need.,Danny France: Transgender teen who died fell into service black hole Published 28 February Share IMAGE SOURCE KATIE FRANCE Image caption Daniel France\s family say he just wanted the world to be a better place for those he loved A transgender teenager who took his own life two weeks into the first lockdown fell into a black hole of mental health services his father said. Danny France was being transferred from Suffolk children and adolescent mental health services to Cambridgeshire adult services when he died in April 2020. His father said concerns remained that people could fall into such a trap where nothing is being done for them. The county council and mental health trust both said action was being taken. Danny\s sister Katie has previously said her brother was an incredibly genuine caring and passionate person and his loss has left a huge void in our lives. The 17-year-old grew up in Stetchworth on the Cambridgeshire-Suffolk border and moved to Cambridge in November 2019 after finding social life college everything was in the city his father Alastair France said. Mr France said while the family had known about Danny\s previous self-harming and suicide attempts his death was so much unexpected because they had made a plan for him to come home the following day. Image caption Alastair France hopes for change following Dannys death Dannys inquest heard that his GP had referred him to Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT) for mental health care but he was still waiting on an assessment by the adult locality team when he died. He had tried to refer himself for counselling but was denied as he was considered too high risk assistant coroner for Cambridgeshire Philip Barlow said in a prevention of future deaths report. The areas First Response Service which provides help for people experiencing a mental health crisis also assessed Danny but he had been considered not in need of urgent intervention. Cambridgeshire County Council had also incorrectly closed two safeguarding referrals for Danny the coroner found. BBC Action Line If you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visit the BBCs Action Line. Mr France said at the time his son moved to Cambridge he was in a situation where the children\s mental health services really didn\t] want to take someone on who will be 18 in six months so you\re waiting for the adult mental health services. The adult mental health services don\t want to do anything he said because they can\t until you\re 18 - so you fall into something of a black hole. Danny\s death was certainly preventable and I think many lessons have been learned. There may be more to learn and if those lessons result in just one young person not going through this then that\s got to be a good thing. IMAGE SOURCE KATIE FRANCE Image caption A coroner says Mr France\s death highlighted a dangerous gap in mental health services Mr France said he believed the pandemic really has hit young people. Danny\s death occurred really early in the lockdowns but we know so many friends of Danny\s that have gone through conjuring with their own demons through the times when they\ve not been able to meet Mr France said. Commenting on the coroner\s finding of considerable delay in obtaining appointments for the gender identity clinic Mr France said such delays were happening to people while they\re going through massive changes in their own bodies and they\re in bodies they hate which is phenomenally difficult for their mental health. A council spokesperson said it was aware of a responsibility to collectively learn from Danny\s tragic death with other partners and said it had put in place actions that will improve our practice when dealing with young people in vulnerable situation. A spokesperson for CPFT said it had made changes adding: We continue to work with partners to learn any additional lessons and further improve treatment pathways so that all young people can access the support they need as quickly as possible.

Ukraine: France seizes Russian ship over sanctions,The Russian-flagged cargo ship is suspected of breaching sanctions imposed because of the Ukraine war.,Ukraine: France seizes Russian ship over sanctions Published 26 February Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption The Baltic Leader ship is being held in Boulogne France has intercepted and impounded a Russian-flagged cargo ship suspected of breaching sanctions imposed because of the invasion of Ukraine. The ship the Baltic Leader was heading from the north-western French city of Rouen to St Petersburg in Russia with a cargo of new cars. It is being held at the Channel port of Boulogne. Russian state media say the vessel is owned by a subsidiary of a bank targeted in recent EU and US sanctions. A regional French official said such a measure was rare but called it a sign of firmness. The US Treasury Department has issued blocking sanctions against the vessel saying it is owned by a subsidiary of Promsvyazbank one of the Russian financial institutions hit by sanctions. However the bank has said it no longer owns the Baltic Leader. It told Reuters news agency that the ship was sold to another firm before the sanctions were imposed. French officials said they were checking whether the vessel was linked to Russian financial interests and that the crew were being co-operative. The process could take up to 48 hours they added. The Russian embassy in Paris said it would send a note of protest to the French foreign ministry over the seizure. Russia attacks Ukraine: More coverage THE BASICS: Why is Putin invading Ukraine?

"Air fare rises are unavoidable, warns Air France-KLM","Higher jet fuel costs will push up the cost of travel this year, says the UK boss of Air France-KLM.",Air fare rises are unavoidable warns Air France-KLM Published 14 February comments Comments Share IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES The cost of air travel is set to rise this year as airlines face soaring overheads the UK boss of Air France-KLM has told the BBC. Fahmi Mahjoub said his airline faced significantly higher fuel and airport costs and as a result higher air fares were quite unavoidable. The airline advised people in the UK to book early as travel rules were eased and demand picked up. It said it was already seeing strong demand for Easter and summer. Mr Mahjoub told the BBC\s Today programme: The increase in cost of living is a very concrete issue for many households but also the airline industry. So I think there is an expectation that airline tickets could become more costly as we move forward and I think the advice we have for customers is simply to plan earlier to be able to avoid those prices increases. On Monday oil prices hit their highest level since 2014 on fears that a possible invasion of Ukraine by Russia could drive up costs in an already tight market. A barrel of benchmark Brent Crude reached $95.56 (£70.13) - up from under $65 a year ago. The rising price of oil has affected everything from heating bills to petrol prices and Mr Mahjoub said the cost of jet fuel was also going up sharply. On top of this Air France-KLM now has to pay 40% more to fly in and out of Heathrow airport he said. Spain relaxes Covid restrictions for UK teenagers Ryanair: Holiday prices likely to rise sharply soon It is not the first travel firm to warn on prices. Last year airline Ryanair and tour operator TUI both predicted holiday costs would be higher than in 2019 as the pandemic eased and demand rebounded. Despite the challenges Air France-KLM says bookings from the UK have jumped since pre-departure and Day 2 Covid tests were scrapped for vaccinated travellers. Mr Mahjoub said bookings for winter sun destinations such as Dubai the US and Thailand had been strong. Demand for half-term Easter and summer flights was also healthy. Air France acquired the Dutch airline KLM to create Air France-KLM Group in 2004 one of the largest air carriers in the world. The deal allows the two airlines to operate as separate companies. On Sunday KLM said it would stop services to Ukraine amid concerns Russia is preparing to invade. Germanys Lufthansa is also considering suspending flights.]

Mali soldiers killed days after France announces exit,"Eight soldiers died in a rebel attack in the north-east of the country, the army says.",Mali soldiers killed days after France announces exit Published 19 February Share Related Topics Mali coup IMAGE SOURCE AFP Image caption The army says soldier were looking for a rebel base when they came under attack (archive photo) The army in Mali says eight of its soldiers have been killed and five are missing after an attack by rebels in the north-eastern Archam region. The fighting comes days after France and its allies said they were withdrawing their forces from Mali. An army statement said that in response to this latest attack the Malian air force killed 57 militants. It said the soldiers were searching for rebel hideouts when they came under fire from unidentified armed men. There has been regional and international concern for Malis security following the expulsion of French troops as well as the foothold gained by Russian mercenaries in the region. This week alone locals told AFP new agency that 40 civilians had been killed in the same region of Archam where rival Islamist groups including Islamic State operate. Mali has been grappling with jihadist unrest for years prompting huge protests in 2020 against then-President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta who was ousted by coup leaders promising to restore security. Q&A: Why are French troops leaving Mali? ANALYSIS: Why France faces so much anger in West Africa EXPLAINER: Russian mercenary plan triggers alarm in West Africa Since then countrys new military leaders have had a series of disagreements with former colonial power France which saw them reneging on an agreement to hold democratic elections this year and expelling the French ambassador when he objected. It culminated in Mali ordering France to withdraw all of its troops after almost 10 years fighting the jihadist threat. Bolstered by soldiers from other Western nations the Mali joint mission - called the Takuba Task Force - will now move a short distance across the border to Niger remaining relatively close their current base. Nigers president said on Friday that the countrys borders would likely be more vulnerable to jihadist militant activity following the withdrawal of French forces and their allies from Mali. Earlier this week he and other West African leaders met with French President Emmanuel Macron ahead of the announcement of the withdrawal of forces from Mali during which they agreed that the troops would relocate to countries in the region.

Seven dead after explosion and fire on France's south-west coast,Two children are among the dead in the incident in the seaside town of St Laurent-de-la-Salanque.,Seven dead after explosion and fire on Frances south-west coast Published 14 February Share IMAGE SOURCE AFP Image caption Frances interior minister said that until emergency services finish their search for survivors the current death toll was only provisional. At least seven people including two children have died in a fire caused by a huge explosion in south-west France. Several buildings were set ablaze on both sides of a street in the seaside town of St Laurent-de-la-Salanque after a blast was heard at 01:30 local time (00:30 GMT) on Monday. Firefighters are still searching for victims in two small blocks of flats damaged by the fire. The cause of the original explosion is not yet known. Frances Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin who visited the scene of the accident on Monday afternoon said the current death toll of seven was only provisional while emergency services continued to search for survivors. Prosecutors currently don\t have any crucial information to determine whether this was accidental or criminal he added. The Pyrénées-Orientales regions fire department attended the scene after receiving a call following an explosion in commercial premises which it said subsequently set fire to the apartments above. The buildings were ravaged by the flames. It was a total panic 59-year-old local resident Nadine Bret told AFP. IMAGE SOURCE AFP Image caption Local residents reported hearing a loud explosion overnight before seeing large flames According to local media reports around 20 people were injured in the fire. One man in his 30s has been taken to hospital in critical condition after he jumped out of a second-storey window in order to escape the fire. The local town hall said that some of those evacuated by firefighters had been provided with accommodation. Our hearts go out to the victims and their families it said in a statement. We will mobilise to help them as best we can in these most tragic circumstances. Related Topics France]

Well have another update for you tomorrow morning. 1. Police try to clear Canada bridge blockade Following days of protests by truckers against Canadas coronavirus rules police have started to clear a blockade of a main crossing to the United States. Truckers have been blocking the Ambassador Bridge which is a vital trade route linking Windsor Ontario with Detroit Michigan. Protesters oppose Covid vaccine mandates with gatherings at other border crossings and in Ottawa. Here we look at whether Canadian PM Justin Trudeau is losing his fight against the truckers. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Protesters tried to argue with police 2. Hundreds fined and tear gas fired at Paris protest There have also been protests in Europe with the self-styled Canadian Freedom Convoy inspiring groups in France. Police have intercepted hundreds of vehicles trying to enter Paris. Tear gas was fired in the capital as demonstrators protested against the country\s coronavirus regulations defying an order banning the convoy. More than 300 tickets were handed out and 54 people arrested Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said. More than 7000 officers are being deployed over the next three days to try to stop the demonstrators. Media caption Watch police in Paris fire tear gas at demonstrators protesting against Frances Covid measures. 3. Removing self-isolation would be a step too far An expert has warned against removing coronavirus self-isolation rules saying it would be a step too far and would risk undoing progress in tackling the virus. Jillian Evans head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian urged a slow and cautious move out of the existing restrictions. Under the current rules in Scotland anyone who tests positive must self-isolate for at least five full days. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that could end in England this month.

Friendship helped us through loss in the pandemic I just remember her as being such fun and always laughing and always there for everybody. It was a tragedy losing her so young says Marcelle Orsi. She and a group of former convent school pupils have created a project in memory of their friend Sonia Kinsella who died of cancer. The women - many of whom are key workers - spent months putting together a play about female solidarity and friendship. Media caption Friendship helped us through loss in the pandemic 5. New Zealand plays Barry Manilow to repel protesters Barry Manilow songs on repeat could be magic for many. But not in New Zealand where authorities have instead used the singers greatest hits to drive people away. In an attempt to dispel protestors camped outside the parliament building songs by the US singer are being played on a 15-minute loop along with the Spanish dance tune Macarena. The protests opposing Covid-19 vaccine mandates began on Tuesday. Demonstrators have retaliated by playing songs such as Twisted Sisters Were Not Gonna Take It.

It said a patrol boat picked up the shipwrecked people in the North Sea off Leffrinckoucke close to the Belgian border and took them to the port of Dunkirk on Thursday morning. Those rescued are believed to be migrants trying to get to the UK. Last November 27 people headed for the UK drowned in the English Channel near Calais after their boat sank. The International Organization for Migration says it was the biggest single loss of life in the Channel since it began collecting data in 2014. Channel migrant deaths: What do we know so far? What happens to migrants who reach the UK? UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to leave no stone unturned to stop human trafficking gangs. The UK and France have agreed to step up joint efforts to prevent such crossings and stop the gangs putting peoples lives at risk. Last year more than 25700 people made the dangerous journey to the UK in small boats - more than three times the 2020 total.

Stolen Roman statue returned to France after 50 years,The statue of the god Bacchus is traced by a Dutch art detective and returned to a French museum.,Stolen Roman statue returned to France after 50 years By Paul Kirby BBC News Published 2 February Share IMAGE SOURCE ARTHUR BRAND Image caption Museum director Catherine Monnet was visibly moved when Arthur Brand handed back the statue Almost half a century after it was stolen a Roman statue of the god Bacchus has been handed back to the French museum where it was displayed. The 1st Century bronze of Bacchus as a child was taken by thieves in December 1973 along with 5000 Roman coins. Art detective Arthur Brand traced the statue to the museum when a client was offered it by an Austrian collector. Fifty years after a theft it\s unheard of that something comes back - normally it\s been destroyed he told the BBC. The 40cm-high (15.7in) statue was dug up on the site of the Gallo-Roman village of Vertillum in eastern France in 1894 and years later featured in a Paris exhibition of Frances finest art pieces. IMAGE SOURCE ARTHUR BRAND Image caption The statue was stolen in December 1973 When Mr Brand handed the statue back to the Musée du Pays Châtillonnais this week director Catherine Monnet said she realised how much more beautiful it was than the copy that had been put on display. The Dutch art sleuth who has built a reputation for tracking down stolen masterpieces around the world said the museum was flabbergasted when he told them he had traced their missing statue. Who is art detective Arthur Brand? Dutch masterpiece stolen for third time He described how he had been contacted by a client who wanted to know more about the statue after he was offered it by an Austrian collector who had bought it legally and in good faith. There were no databases in 1973 but Mr Brand eventually found a reference to it in an archaeology magazine dating back to 1927 and French police then found their report from the time of the theft. I contacted the collector. He didn\t want to have a stolen piece in his collection so he wanted to give it back but French law dictates that a small amount has to be paid for safekeeping. That small amount in relation to the statues value is still a considerable sum of money. While half was paid by the local authority in Chatillon the rest was provided by an auction house specialising in ancient art in the English port town of Harwich. The piece belongs in the museum so it\s only right people can get together and make that happen said Aaron Hammond of Timeline Auctions. According to Mr Brand the museum director cried tears of joy when she saw the statue: I thought she was going to drop it she was so nervous.

Covid-19: France to relax travel rules from the UK,"Vaccinated travellers will no longer need a compelling reason to enter France, or have to isolate.",Covid-19: France to relax travel rules from the UK Published 13 January Share Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS France will relax its restrictions for those travelling from the UK from Friday the government has announced. Vaccinated travellers will no longer need a compelling reason to enter France and will not have to self-isolate when they arrive. But a negative Covid test taken 24 hours before leaving the UK will still be required for all those arriving. Travel companies welcomed the news - with Jet2 reporting a sharp spike in flight bookings to ski destinations. French holiday bookings surge after rule change France brought in the restrictions on 18 December in an attempt to slow the spread of the Omicron variant. People who are not vaccinated will still need a compelling reason to enter France and must still isolate for 10 days upon arrival. The country is battling a surge in Covid-19 infections. On Thursday there were a record 368 817 new cases and 341 deaths according to Johns Hopkins University. How can I tell I have Omicron? What tests do I need to go on holiday? Half of Europe will catch Omicron - WHO Both holidaymakers and the travel industry have welcomed the change. Melissa Hamblett from Gloucester has had to reschedule a trip to Disneyland for their son Maxs birthday five times since they originally booked in 2020. Our son doesn\t know the update yet he\s at school right now she said. He\s going to be so happy. She said it has been really disappointing having to keep rescheduling. I was convinced it] would be happening again. I got bored of getting my hopes up. IMAGE SOURCE MELISSA HAMBLETT Image caption We\ve got a countdown chalkboard in our kitchen says big Disney fan Melissa Hamblett Eurostar welcomed the change and said it would increase the number of its services in the coming weeks while Brittany Ferries called it a great relief. I can only hope that we have seen the last border closure of the Covid crisis said Christophe Mathieu boss of the ferry company. Thousands of Brittany Ferries passengers have been disrupted and millions of pounds in income has been lost as a consequence of draconian measures like border closures. Around 17 million British nationals visit France every year - and ABTA which represents travel firms said it was one of the most popular destinations for UK holidaymakers. Thousands of people head there for ski breaks at this time of year so this will be a huge relief for customers with holidays booked there for the next few weeks who have been waiting anxiously for news said ABTA. We are still waiting for more details from the French government on entry requirements such as the rules that will apply for children. Travellers should continue to monitor the Foreign Office travel advice. Jet2 announced it was resuming flights to French ski destinations with its boss adding: This is the positive news that skiers and snowboarders have been looking forward to and the spike in bookings for ski flights has been both sharp and immediate. Image caption Britons accounted for one in four tourists in Chamonix before the Covid pandemic France tightened its restrictions earlier this month making remote working compulsory for those who can and limiting public gatherings for indoor events. Eating and drinking on long distance transport is banned cafés and bars can provide table service only and nightclubs are closed. On Thursday the French Senate approved a controversial pass which requires people to be fully vaccinated to visit a range of spaces including bars and restaurants. It also removes the option of showing a negative test to get in. Thousands protested against the pass on Saturday with many angry at President Emmanuel Macron who has said he wants to piss off unvaccinated citizens. In total 12.6 million people have been infected in France and more than 127000 have died. You may be interested in watching: Media caption My parents won\t let me get the Covid vaccine]

Covid: France suspends transit ban for UK nationals during Christmas period,EU-based Brits trying to get home will be allowed to cross France during the Christmas period.,Covid: France suspends transit ban for UK nationals during Christmas period Published 31 December 2021 Share Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES UK nationals will be allowed to travel through France if they are going to their home in an EU country during the festive period. France suspended its Covid restriction after UK travellers faced difficulties reaching their country of residence. Eurotunnel which had earlier issued warnings to customers said it was delighted by the move. People from the UK are still largely banned from going to France unless they have a compelling reason. France travel ban on UK tourists takes effect What tests do I need to go on holiday? Earlier this month French ministers tightened travel rules for the UK citing concerns about the spread of the Omicron variant. Since 18 December British citizens have needed an essential reason to travel to France with some exemptions in place. It had been thought that exemptions covered those crossing France in order to get to their home in another EU country. However on Wednesday both P&O and Eurotunnel said the French government had issued new rules meaning British people could no longer transit France by road to reach their country of residence in the EU unless they hold French residency. The British government said it was urgently seeking clarification about any new restrictions that would affect UK nationals. In response the French government insisted that UK nationals who reside in another EU country are deemed to be third country nationals and are therefore not allowed to cross France to get home under the current Covid rules. However it noted that a large number of British nationals residing in an EU country have travelled in good faith to the UK for the festive season and are experiencing difficulties in reaching their country of residence. Faced with this situation instructions of tolerance have been sent to police officers at the borders with the United Kingdom in order to allow these nationals to transit through France to reach their residence in a country of the European Union. The French Ministry of the Interior added that unlike UK citizens EU nationals coming from the UK to their residence in the EU were not impacted by the transit ban and were free to travel through France. Eurotunnel the company which runs vehicle-carrying trains between Dover and Calais said it was delighted that the French government has responded positively to its requests for flexibility in travel rules. On Twitter the company said the flexibility for passengers would be subject to their initial] journey to the UK being completed before 28 Dec 2021. A UK government spokesperson said: British nationals who are currently in the UK but resident in the EU will be able to return to their home through France over the New Year period without disruption. We remain in close contact with the French authorities and will update our own travel advice with the latest information. The confusion over travel rules comes as France is experiencing record numbers of infections. Meanwhile Germany has said it will lift a ban on UK tourists entering the country from midnight local time on 4 January. Those who are fully vaccinated or have an important reason for travel will be allowed to enter the country when the ban put in place earlier this month is overturned. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was a welcome development.]

French ministers have made keeping schools open a priority despite a recent surge in Covid-19 cases fuelled by the Omicron variant. Teachers say Covid rules in school are confusing and constantly changing.. The government said almost 40% of primary teachers and 24% of secondary teachers had walked out on Thursday. But those figures were well below estimates by unions which said they expected about 75% of primary teachers to go on strike. The top Snuipp-FSU union said it expected one in two primary schools to close on Thursday in a historical mobilisation of teachers on a scale not seen in decades. The nationwide strike was organised by 11 unions representing teachers parents and other school staff. In cities across France on Thursday teachers took to the streets to vent their anger at the governments Covid policies. We had reached such a level of exasperation tiredness and anger that we didn\t have any other option but to organise a strike to send a strong message to the government said Elisabeth Allain-Moreno national secretary of the SE-UNSA teachers union. Some parents said they sympathised with and held no grudge against teachers who had walked off the job. Outside a school in north-east Paris one parent Akim Aouchiche told the AFP news agency that classes are too big they don\t get paid enough their working conditions aren\t the best. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption French teachers walked out en masse in protest against Covid safety and testing rules in schools The unions said the government and the education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer were to blame for what they called a chaotic situation in schools. The main trigger for the strike was Frances health protocol which has been changed a number of times since December. Under rules announced on 2 January a day before the start of the new school year students exposed to a Covid case were required to take an antigen or PCR test and then self-test two and then four days later to continue classes in person. As coronavirus infections surged the rule change caused massive pressure on testing capacity with long queues seen outside pharmacies. In response to this huge demand the government this week eased rules on Covid checks for students. On Monday French Prime Minister Jean Castex said students will be allowed to do self-tests instead of a PCR if one of their classmates tested positive. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Prime Minister Jean Castex eased the testing rules for school children on Monday this week But the relaxation has caused concerns for the safety of teachers as France reported a record 368149 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday. The unions say they the governments lack of communication frequent changes to testing and insufficient protection against Covid has left them unable to teach properly. But the government has defended its policies which it says are necessary to keep schools open. I know it\s tough but a strike does not solve problems. One does not strike against a virus the education minister Mr Blanquer told BFM TV. The strike comes at a politically awkward time for French President Emmanuel Macron who is expected to seek a second term in an April election. His rivals have capitalised on the strike to criticise Mr Macron. I feel the enormous pain both of the school community and especially of parents conservative candidate Valerie Pecresse told French TV.

Covid self-isolation in England being cut to five full days The self-isolation period for people who test positive for Covid-19 is being cut to five full days in England from Monday Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said. The change means people will be able to end isolation after negative lateral flow tests on days five and six with Mr Javid saying this meant they could leave at the start of day six.

High on the list is a 75-year-old singer-songwriter all but forgotten in the UK but who in his adopted home of France ranks among the greats. Murray Head has been feted in France since the mid-1970s when his hit song Say It Aint So Joe became a national staple. Generations have slow-danced at the end of discos to Heads plangent tenor and the song still gets a regular airing on oldies radio shows. And the odd thing is the French persist in thinking its about broken hearts. I kept telling them it wasn\t a love song - it\s actually about politics and Richard Nixon says Head. But people were so disappointed that I stopped disabusing them. Now I think who cares? Half-way through another nationwide French tour he is ruminating on his long career and the odd twist that brought him minor rock-god status across the Channel. The thing about the French is they are very very faithful. When they like you they stick with you he says. In the UK everyone is chased out by the next media sensation. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Head pictured acting opposite Glenda Jackson in1971s Sunday Bloody Sunday Head did have a brief time in the British limelight.

Before its original release Head had a moment of glory when he was chosen by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber to be their first Judas Iscariot singing with Deep Purples Ian Gillan in the pre-theatre album version of Jesus Christ Superstar. A very early and very silly music video shows Head lip-synching unconvincingly to the Superstar hit single in the rafters of a bombed-out church while a group of Trinidadian backing singers mime the chorus down below. Somewhere I have a cassette recording of the meeting where Tim and Andrew pitched the idea to me he says. And there\s this stunned silence after they explain that they\re making a rock musical of the Christian story and I say \You have got to be effin\ joking!\ Heroes in another land IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Jane Birkin pictured earlier this year is primarily known in the UK as the voice of Je Taime Vince Taylor - Leather-clad rock n roller and writer of Brand New Cadillac Taylor came to Paris in 1961. He built up a huge fanbase in France and other European countries but was virtually unknown in the UK. He died in Geneva in 1991. Roger Hodgson - The ex-Supertramp frontman has kept touring in France where in 2012 he was made a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters. Jane Birkin - Partner and muse of French superstar Serge Gainsbourg the British-born singer and actress is still immensely popular across the Channel. In the UK she is known only for her heavy breathing on Je Taime. Charlie Winston - The Cornwall-born singer had a French number one with Like a Hobo and lives on the Cote dAzur. Sixto Diaz Rodriguez - And away from France - this singer-songwriter was a huge hit in South Africa in the 1970s but unknown in the US. His rediscovery was the subject of the film Searching for Sugar Man. Head was born in 1946 in London into a theatrical family. His mother went on to play Madame Maigret in a BBC adaptation of the George Simenon novels and his father made promotional films. His younger brother Anthony Head found fame as an actor playing Giles in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Murray also acted - notably in the 1971 hit Sunday Bloody Sunday. But his main ambition was musical. He had an early start in 1964 when he won a competition run by Radio Luxembourg (alongside John Paul Jones future bassist of Led Zeppelin) which led to a recording contract. Jesus Christ Superstar could have been the breakthrough but the album sold poorly in the UK and by the time the stage show became a hit Head had moved on. Later there was a minor success with One Night in Bangkok from another musical Chess but for British intents and purposes that was more or less it. Image caption Head acted in UK TV dramas such as Casualty (pictured alongside Anita Dobson and Adjoa Andoh) Head describes his parents as being France mad. They came on annual camping trips to France and sent him to the French lycee in London. He hated it but it meant he knew France its language and history. Someone told me once that the truest sign of intelligence was the ability to adapt - and that is what I did he says. France was where I was popular so France became where I earned my keep. With so many years moving between the English and French worlds Head has become an expert sans pareil on the differences between the two musical cultures. Because theirs is a literary nation the French can\t hear two words strung together in a song without comparing it to Rimbaud or Baudelaire he says. They\re obsessed with lyrics and too often the music gets pushed to the background. So for the actual music they like the Anglo-Saxons. Frankly they don\t understand a word of what we are singing but that doesn\t matter. They found emotional overtones in Say It Ain\t So Joe that I certainly had never intended. But I wasn\t going to complain! Le Monde recalled earlier this year: A fully-authenticated hit in France Say It Ain\t So Joe seemed to promise a glowing career to the young Murray Head. He had it - but only over here. Head has just moved out of his Paris flat and bought an old house in the Béarn region of the Pyrenees which he is renovating. France is where he intends to stay. There\s never been the remotest interest in me in England. I never made up my mind to live in France. But France made up my mind for me. I\ve tried to owe something to England - but England\s never wanted it. Never wanted it at all.]
Covid: Thousands protest in France against proposed new vaccine pass,The protests are against a draft law which would in effect ban the unvaccinated from public areas.,Covid: Thousands protest in France against proposed new vaccine pass Published 8 January Share Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption About 18000 people attended the protest in the capital Paris French authorities say more than 105000 people have taken part in protests across the country against the introduction of a new coronavirus pass. A new draft law would in effect ban unvaccinated people from public life. Demonstrators in the capital Paris held placards emblazoned with phrases like no to vaccine passes. Interior Ministry officials said 34 people were arrested and some 10 police officers were injured after the protests turned violent in some places. The bill which passed its first reading in the lower house of Frances parliament on Thursday would remove the option of showing a negative Covid-19 test to gain access to a host of public venues. Instead people would have to be fully vaccinated to visit a range of spaces including bars and restaurants. The government says it expects the new rules to come into force on 15 January although the opposition-dominated Senate could delay the process. But demonstrators on Saturday accused the government of trampling on their freedoms and treating citizens unequally. Others targeted their anger at the president Emmanuel Macron over comments he made earlier this week in relation to unvaccinated citizens telling Le Parisian newspaper that he wanted to piss them off. One protester hospital administrator Virginie Houget told the Reuters news agency that Mr Macron\s remarks were the last straw. And in Paris where some 18000 people marched against the new law demonstrators responded to his coarse language by chanting: We\ll piss you off. French MPs get death threats over Covid-19 pass Covid vaccination centres vandalised in France TV images showed altercations between protesters and police turning violent in some places. In Montpellier officers used teargas during clashes with the demonstrators. Turnout for the protests was estimated to be about four times higher than the last major demonstrations on 18 December when some 25500 people marched across the country. But despite the vocal protests opposition to the new measures is not widespread and recent polling suggests the vast majority of people back the vaccine pass. France is one of the most highly vaccinated countries in Europe with more than 90% of over-12s eligible for the shot fully vaccinated. Meanwhile new coronavirus infections are rising rapidly across France as the new Omicron variant takes hold. The country recorded more than 300000 new cases for the second time in a week on Friday and admissions to intensive care wards are rising steadily putting healthcare systems under strain. Some hospitals have reported that some 85% of ICU patients are not vaccinated against Covid-19.]

Consent for the use of cookies is key to the EUs data-privacy regulation and a major priority for the CNIL. The social-media firms have three months to comply or face penalties of 100000 euros for each day of delay.

In its statement the Commission Nationale Informatique & Libertés said it had found that while the tech giants provided a virtual button to allow the immediate acceptance of cookies there was no equivalent to refuse them as easily. Google which was fined 150m euros said: People trust us to respect their right to privacy and keep them safe. We understand our responsibility to protect that trust and are committing to further changes and active work with the CNIL in the] light of this decision. Facebook now owned by Meta said it was reviewing the decision to fine it 60m euros.

Previous fines Cookies are highly valuable for Google and Facebook as ways to personalise advertising which is their primary source of revenue. But privacy advocates have campaigned against it. Since the EU passed a law on personal data in 2018 internet companies face stricter rules that oblige them to seek the direct consent of users before installing cookies on their computers. This is not the first time Google owned by Alphabet has been slapped with heavy fines for falling foul of European law. It was also the target of the CNILs previous record fine of 100m euros in 2020.

Ms Kiefer said the issues had been resolved since then. In 2020 the CNIL strengthened consent rights over ad trackers saying websites operating in France should keep a register of internet users refusal to accept cookies for at least six months. It also said internet users should be able to easily reconsider any initial agreement concerning cookies via a web link or an icon that should be visible on all the website pages.]

Dakar Rally: France opens terrorism probe into Saudi Arabia blast,The explosion in Saudi Arabia last week badly wounded French rally driver Philippe Boutron.,Dakar Rally: France opens terrorism probe into Saudi Arabia blast Published 6 January Share IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption The explosion happened two days before the start of the 2022 Dakar Rally in Saudi Arabia French prosecutors have opened a terrorism investigation into a blast in Saudi Arabia that badly wounded a French driver in the Dakar Rally. The explosion damaged a support vehicle for the Sodicars Racing team as it left a hotel in Jeddah last Thursday. The driver Philippe Boutron suffered serious leg injuries. He was later repatriated to France and was placed in a medically-induced coma. Saudi authorities have not commented on the French prosecutors decision. Saudi police said on Saturday that a preliminary investigation into the explosion had found there was no criminal suspicion but rally organiser ASO told reporters that officers had not yet ruled out a malicious act. Sainz wins Dakar Rally as Alonso is 13th The Dakar Rally which started in 1978 as a race from Paris to the Senegalese capital has been held in Saudi Arabia since 2020 for safety reasons. On Thursday two days before the start of the event\s first stage a support vehicle belonging to Sodicars was brought to a sudden halt by a sudden explosion outside the Donatello Hotel near Jeddah\s international airport according to ASO. A Sodicars team member told French sports newspaper LEquipe that the blast ripped through the floor of the vehicle which then caught fire. Mr Boutron was injured but the other five French citizens travelling in the car with him were unharmed. Mr Boutron who works in marketing and is also president of French Ligue 2 football team Orléans underwent surgery in Saudi Arabia before being flown to France for further treatment at the Percy military hospital in Clamart near Paris. Sodicars said in a statement on Tuesday that the 61-year-old driver\s legs were bashed up and that doctors had placed him in a medically-induced coma in order to alleviate his suffering. Mr Boutron had now emerged from the coma his son Benoît told Radio Monte Carlo on Thursday morning. He is indeed seriously injured on both legs we will know more in 10 days but we must remain cautious at this stage he told the station. French anti-terrorism prosecutors meanwhile announced they had opened a preliminary investigation into multiple attempted killings in connection with a terrorist group without providing further details. The French foreign ministry also updated its travel advice for Saudi Arabia warning its citizens to exercise maximum vigilance in the wake of the blast. An investigation by Saudi authorities is under way to determine the cause of this explosion. The possibility of a criminal act has not been ruled out it said. In November 2020 several people were wounded when a bomb exploded at a Remembrance Day ceremony organised by the French consulate in Jeddah.

The FR4052 flight took off at 18:30 GMT on Monday destined for Faro in Portugal but then had to be diverted. Ryanair said the plane landed in Brest France after a minor technical issue which caused an unidentified smoke smell in the cabin. Passengers waited three hours before another plane took them to the Algarve. A Ryanair spokesperson said: Passengers disembarked the aircraft as normal and were taken to a secure area in Brest airport where they were provided with refreshments. An aircraft from London Stansted was arranged to carry the passengers on the remainder of their journey to Faro following a delay of under three hours. Following an inspection of the aircraft by our engineers the aircraft was released back to service. The airline insisted the diversion was a precaution.

France travel ban: UK tourists need essential reason for entry,France imposed a travel ban on travellers from the UK from Friday due to high Covid infection rates.,France travel ban: UK tourists need essential reason for entry Published 18 December 2021 Share Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES New rules have come into force for people entering France from the UK as the French government tries to slow the spread of the Omicron variant. Travellers need an essential reason for their trip unless they are French nationals residents or hauliers. French Prime Minister Jean Castex has warned that Omicron is spreading at lightning speed in Europe. He said it will likely become dominant in France by the start of next year. The travel ban will mean only those with compelling reasons will be able to travel between the UK and France and tourist or business trips will not be permitted. The move has had a knock-on effect on freight traffic with long queues of lorries and lengthy tailbacks on the M20 motorway in Kent heading to Dover and at the entrance to the Channel Tunnel on Saturday. IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption Freight lorries queuing at the port of Dover in Kent Lorry drivers are still allowed to travel along with French citizens and legal residents returning home their partners and children and EU citizens travelling home through France. People intending to travel through France to another country are only allowed to make their journey if they stay within the international area of an airport for less than 24 hours. Anyone still permitted to travel will have to show evidence of a negative Covid test taken within 24 hours and must isolate for at least two days on arrival. Across Europe health officials are braced for a wave of infections. The UK has been hard hit - on Friday there were 93045 infections reported in the UK setting a new record for the third day running and there are nearly 15000 confirmed Omicron cases. France to drastically restrict travel from UK What are Frances new rules for UK travellers? Covid cases hit record as booster drive continues Chancellor to hold Omicron crisis talks with firms Ahead of the travel ban many people on Friday tried to make their way to France from the UK. Ports reported long queues to board ferries and Eurostar advised ticketless customers to avoid St Pancras station in London. Ferry company DFDS reported services to be busy ahead of the ban Eurotunnel also reported a large amount of traffic on Friday and there were long queues at St Pancras station as people waited for Eurostar trains. While some rushed to beat the deadline several people messaged Eurostar on social media to demand refunds on tickets they could no longer use. The company has offered a voucher or the opportunity to rebook tickets without a further fee. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Passengers queuing to board Eurostar trains at St Pancras on Friday afternoon The office of French Prime Minister Jean Castex said the UK was facing a landslide of Omicron cases and the extremely rapid spread of the variant had prompted the travel restrictions. Travel firms have described the French restrictions as a hammer blow to their industry.

Covid: France to drastically restrict travel from UK,"Non-residents will need compelling reasons to travel, as France tries to slow the spread of Omicron.",Covid: France to drastically restrict travel from UK Published 16 December 2021 Share Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption France is seeing a rise in cases but has fewer confirmed Omicron cases than the UK France is tightening Covid restrictions for travellers arriving from the UK as the government in Paris tries to slow the spread of the Omicron variant. From Saturday most travellers who are not French residents or citizens must give a compelling reason. Some lorry drivers and students will be able to travel but Brits visiting relatives are not currently listed. All arrivals will have to provide a negative Covid test less than 24 hours old and isolate for at least two days. Confirmed Omicron cases are currently much higher in the UK than in France. French citizens their partners and children legal residents and EU citizens travelling home through France wont need an essential reason to travel - but must still abide by all other rules. The UK recorded 78610 new Covid cases on Wednesday the highest daily number reported since the start of the pandemic. Slightly more than 10000 have been confirmed as Omicron but it is thought that about twice that number are cases of the new variant. France reported 65713 new Covid cases over a similar period but has only 240 confirmed cases of Omicron. Follow live updates What are Frances new rules for UK travellers? New UK cases record as Whitty warns worse to come What can South Africa teach us about Omicron? A statement from French Prime Minister Jean Castex\s office (in French) said the UK was in its own words about to face a landslide linked to Omicron in the coming days. As the Omicron variant spreads extremely quickly in the United Kingdom the French government has decided to re-implement compelling reasons for travels from and to the United Kingdom and to reinforce mandatory tests at departures and arrivals it said. However UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps confirmed lorry drivers would be exempt from the new restrictions following fears over the impact on supply chains. Downing Street has signalled there are no plans to ban French travellers from the UK. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that rising cases of Omicron globally mean that tighter border measures wouldn\t be effective or proportionate in slowing the import of the new variant. France and UK feel further apart than ever A lot of people will be urgently consulting the French governments list of what constitutes a compelling reason for coming to France. And a lot of people are going to be disappointed. If you have booked a skiing holiday for example you will not be able to come. Thats clear - all holidaying is out. If you are a UK citizen wishing to spend Christmas with your retired parents who live in France it doesnt look good either. The list appears to state that the only Britons allowed in are those with registered homes in France plus transport workers and some students. Without question the end-of-year plans of many families will be badly affected and travel companies are predicting a wave of cancellations. In fact Alpine resorts say that a lot of British skiers have already cancelled because they foresaw there would be difficulties. With travel to the UK from France already hit by tough restrictions decreed from London (self-isolation till results of compulsory PCR test) the two countries feel more apart than ever. From midnight on Saturday local time (23:00 GMT on Friday) anyone coming from the UK will be required to have tested negative by PCR or antigen test less than 24 hours before their arrival in France. They will be asked to register prior to their trip on a digital platform and provide an address for their stay in France. Once in France they will be expected to self-isolate for a week unless they have a second negative test in which case they can end their quarantine after 48 hours. These restrictions had previously only applied to arrivals who are not fully vaccinated. France has also advised people intending to travel to the UK to postpone their trips. Image caption Hamza right with his mother two younger brothers and younger sister has been forced to cancel a trip to Disneyland Paris Frances list of compelling reasons for entry does not include tourism family visits or non-urgent work. Hamza Taouzzale is among those whove been forced to cancel a trip - a family holiday to Disneyland Paris. We only told the kids yesterday and they were so excited.

We were all packed and ready to leave too. Just heard the news this morning and are devastated. Would have been the first family trip in five years. Brittany Ferries said the new rules could be a hammer blow to our Christmas season. In the context of an Omicron variant that is passing through the French population as it is in the UK further border controls seem as unnecessary as they are unwelcome it said in a statement.

France's Bogdanoff TV twins die of Covid six days apart,Grichka and Igor Bogdanoff had hosted a TV science and science-fiction show in the 1980s.,Frances Bogdanoff TV twins die of Covid six days apart Published 4 January Share Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Grichka and Igor Bogdanoff had tried in recent years to relaunch their media careers Grichka and Igor Bogdanoff became Frances most famous twins hosting a TV science and science-fiction show in the 1980s on a spaceship set. They died of coronavirus within days of each other in hospital Grichka on 28 December and his brother on Monday. Aged 72 the brothers had not been vaccinated against Covid-19. Their friends said they were convinced their healthy lifestyle would protect them and they were admitted to hospital in mid-December. Although their families did not specify the cause of their deaths their lawyer Edouard de Lamaze confirmed they had both contracted the virus. Family friend Pierre-Jean Chalençon said they had left it too late to seek hospital treatment deciding it was similar to flu. People have said they were anti-vaxxers but they absolutely weren\t he told BFMTV. Several friends told them to get themselves vaccinated but they felt because of their lifestyle and their lack of] comorbidity they weren\t at risk of Covid. The Bogdanoff brothers were a pair of eccentrics descended from Austrian nobility. Feted for their initial Saturday afternoon TV programme Temps X which ran from 1979 they were synonymous for years with popular science and were part of public life for the rest of their lives. Their programme on TF1 was for years seen in some ways as highlighting cutting-edge technology according to Le Monde which described them as icons from a kitsch period of culture. Temps X showcased other TV shows such as Doctor Who The Prisoner and Star Trek with guests including electronic music pioneer Jean-Michel Jarre. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption The twins presented their hit TV series from 1979-1987 However when the TV channel went private in 1987 they were dropped. During the 1990s their facial features changed dramatically leaving them with odd-looking chins lips and cheek-bones. We are proud of having faces like extra-terrestrials they once said. Grichka Bogdanoff was adamant that they had never had what people call cosmetic surgery insisting that he and his brother were experimental by nature and had tried out very advanced technology. That was contradicted by their friend former education minister Luc Ferry who said they had both had Botox injections. The brothers later tried their hands at academic work writing doctoral theses in mathematics and theoretical physics which were both panned by their peers. Ridiculed by sections of French media they won a 2014 court case for defamation before losing a lawsuit against the French National Centre for Scientific Research. Asked why they had chosen not to have the Covid vaccines if they were not themselves anti-vaxxers Luc Ferry said on Monday: Like Igor Grichka wasn\t antivax he was just antivax for himself. They were both athletic with not an inch of fat and they thought the vaccine was more dangerous than the virus. Before they were admitted to hospital the twins had been working on a pilot project to resurrect their old TV show again set on a spaceship and planned for broadcast on another channel in the near future. In a statement on Monday Igor Bogdanoff\s family said he had gone towards the light surrounded by his children and family. Media caption Experts answer your questions about the Omicron variant]

The mosque in the town of Beauvais will remain shut for six months local authorities say. Oise\s prefect said sermons there called jihadist fighters heroes and incited hatred and violence. France has been carrying out checks on Islamic places of worship suspected of having links to extremism. Two weeks ago Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said he was starting a process to close the Great Mosque of Beauvais 100km (62 miles) north of Paris because the imam was targeting Christians homosexuals and Jews in his sermons. Authorities gave the mosque 10 days to respond. The mosques imam was a recent convert to Islam Agence France-Presse quoted local newspaper Courrier Picard as saying. A lawyer for the association managing the mosque told the newspaper his remarks had been taken out of context. The lawyer said that the imam who was speaking on a voluntary basis had been suspended from his duties. But the interior ministry said the man who was presented as an occasional speaker but who in reality acts as a regular imam had defended a rigorous practice of Islam and its superiority to the laws of the Republic. Muslims under pressure to sign French values charter Beheading of teacher deepens divisions in France Last year Mr Darmanin announced a crackdown on mosques with extremist links saying some could be closed if found to be encouraging separatism. It was a response to the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty and the fatal stabbing of three people in a cathedral in Nice in October 2020 blamed on Islamist extremists. Frances interior ministry said it had investigated around 100 mosques and prayer halls over such extremism in recent months out of a total of more than 2620 in France.

Covid: France tightens restrictions amid Omicron surge,Germany and Greece also toughen measures in a bid to tackle infections amid fears about Omicron.,Covid: France tightens restrictions amid Omicron surge Published 28 December 2021 Share IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES France has announced tighter Covid restrictions amid concerns over the Omicron variant. From 3 January remote working will become compulsory for those who can and public gatherings will be limited to 2000 people for indoor events. The news comes as France recorded more than 100000 new infections on Saturday - the highest number reported in the country since the pandemic began. But Frances prime minister did not bring in a New Years Eve curfew. Countries across Europe are tightening restrictions as infections rise and the new Omicron variant spreads through the continent. Studies suggest the strain is milder than Delta with a 30% to 70% lower chance of infected people ending up in hospital. But there are fears the sheer number of cases could overwhelm hospitals. A film without an ending French Prime Minister Jean Castex told reporters the pandemic felt like a film without an ending as he unveiled the new measures at a news conference following a crisis cabinet meeting. Health Minister Olivier Véran said coronavirus infections were doubling every two days warning of a mega wave of new cases. The new rules also include limits on outdoor public gatherings - which will be restricted to 5000 people - and a ban on eating and drinking on long distance transport. Nightclubs will remain closed until further notice and cafés and bars will be able to provide table service only. Employees who work from home will have to do so at least three days a week. Mask-wearing will become compulsory in city centres. The government is also shortening the length of time between booster shots from four months after the last vaccination to three months. Frances planned vaccine pass - which will require proof of vaccination not just a negative test to enter public spaces - will come into effect from 15 January if parliament approves a draft bill. But Mr Castex did not introduce a full lockdown or New Years Eve curfew. Schools will also reopen as planned on 3 January. According to the countrys coronavirus dashboard France currently has an average of more than 70000 new daily infections. On Monday more than 1600 new hospitalisations were recorded bringing the total number of people in hospital as a result of Covid-19 to 17000 according to data from Frances public health authority. Omicron: Good news bad news and what it all means Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Elsewhere in Europe additional restrictions were announced in Germany and Greece as governments seek to stem the tide of positive cases. Gatherings in Germany have been restricted and gyms swimming pools nightclubs and cinemas will be closed to the public in several states. Private gatherings of vaccinated people will also be limited to a maximum of 10. Local media report that at least 10 police officers were injured and around 100 protesters were arrested in the German town of Bautzen on Monday as people took to the streets to protest against new measures. From 3 January the Greek government will require bars and restaurants to close by midnight and tables will be limited to six customers. Venues will not be allowed to cater for standing customers and if they do not comply music will be banned in those establishments the Reuters news agency reported. Denmark - a country of 5.8 million people - currently has the worlds highest infection rate with 1612 cases per 100000 people. Seven deaths were recorded in the last 24 hours. It has closed cultural attractions and limited opening hours in bars and restaurants in a bid to stem new infections. And before Christmas Iceland cut the number of people allowed at gatherings amid soaring case numbers. Until mid-December the island nation had never reported more than 200 daily cases but in the past 24 hours it has registered a record 672 infections. Restrictions on opening hours come into force on bars and restaurants in Finland on Tuesday with bars closing at 18:00 and restaurants allowed to serve food until 20:00 as long as customers have a Covid passport. Some fast food chains have said they will also close at 18:00. In contrast in the UK the Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said no further Covid restrictions will be implemented in England before the new year.

Hundreds given false results after Sydney lab error Hundreds of people were told they did not have Covid when they had tested positive after a data processing error at a lab in Sydney Australia. The SydPath lab apologised in a statement on Tuesday and said the mistake which affected 886 people in total had happened as workers faced an unprecedented volume of tests. The Australian state of New South Wales is seeing rising infection numbers following the arrival of the Omicron variant. Some of those affected have expressed concern that they may have unknowingly infected their loved ones over Christmas.

US halves self-isolation time for asymptomatic cases The United States has halved the recommended isolation time for people with asymptomatic Covid infections from 10 to five days. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said that this must be followed by five days of wearing a mask around others. While the new recommendations are not mandatory they are closely followed by many businesses and policymakers across the US. The CDC said the change is motivated by science demonstrating that most transmission happens early in the course of illness.

Medic hopes vaccine uptake will mean Wales avoids more lockdowns More than one and a half million people have now had a booster in Wales and a senior doctor says he hopes this means there won\t be a return to lockdowns. British Medical Association chairman in Wales Dr David Bailey said after the big push to get people jabbed before Christmas he would expect to see reduced Omicron transmission in the very early part of the new year. New rules including limits on social gatherings came into force on Sunday in Wales.
