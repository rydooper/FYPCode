The 331st Guards Parachute Regiment had high hopes of being the first but now represents the disintegration of Russias plan for a quick war. The regiment\s commanding officer Col Sergei Sukharev was killed in Ukraine on 13 March and was posthumously awarded the Hero of the Russian Federation medal. At his funeral deputy defence minister Gen Yuri Sadovenko said the colonel lived for the future for the future of our people a future without Nazism. IMAGE SOURCE GTRK-KOSTROMA Image caption Col Sergei Sukharev commander of the Kostroma 331st regiment was also killed Casualties among Russian forces are not widely reported in Russia itself but using open source material the BBC has pieced together the story of their advance and found that at least 39 other members of the elite 331st regiment have died. The men were part of a column that advanced into Ukraine from Belarus led by Russias airborne forces known by the acronym VDV. Their presence underlined the priority of their objective - advancing on the capital Kyiv. That advance swiftly got drawn into a destructive stalemate in districts on the outskirts of Kyiv which soon became synonymous with the viciousness of the war: Bucha Irpin and Hostomel. Videos that emerged online from these battles showed combat vehicles used by Russian airborne forces with V signs painted onto them. IMAGE SOURCE TWITTER One video we found shows several damaged light armoured vehicles from the VDV abandoned after an attack by Ukrainian special forces. Another shows several vehicles from the Russian airborne forces apparently abandoned. The men in the 331st regarded themselves as the pick of Russia\s army. In a video posted online last May a general tells soldiers of the 331st Parachute Regiment that they are the best of the best. The unit served in the Balkans Chechnya and the 2014 Russian intervention in the Donbas region of Ukraine and regularly took part in Red Square parades in Moscow. The 331st was also a showcase for Russias policy of replacing national service soldiers with contraktniki - professionals under contract. It is understandable why the generals should have given it an important role in the invasion.

RIP - this post is no longer public From early March reports began to circulate of deaths in the 331st. It took time for bodies to be returned to Kostroma the community where it is based 300km north-east of Moscow. As the funerals started an anguished conversation began playing out on social media. Memorial walls on V\Kontakte - the Russian equivalent of Facebook - pledge eternal memory and feature pictures of candles.

Now you are in heaven and you will protect us from there! You will always live in our hearts and you will forever be a real hero to me! Although many posts appear to accept Kremlin explanations that the war is being waged against Ukrainian fascists some also display anxiety about the lack of reliable information. IMAGE SOURCE VK.COM Image caption A post mourning Sergey Duganov On the memorial wall for Sergeant Sergei Duganov one woman wrote: Nobody knows anything. The 331st regiment is disappearing. Almost every day photos of our Kostroma boys get published. It sends shivers down my spine. What\s happening? When will this end? When will people stop dying? Her post was followed by another which exclaimed: Kostroma has lost so many young men what a tragedy. Another pleaded: God how many more death notifications shall we receive? Please have mercy on our boys help them survive return them back home to their wives and mothers. I\m begging you! IMAGE SOURCE VK.COM Image caption Yanosh Leonovs partner writes: You are a real hero you are the best father a loved and loving husband a loyal friend and a real fighter. Speaking out about the war in Russia carries great risks but there are hints of a loss of faith in the Kremlin\s arguments for war. On the memorial page for one sergeant a woman asks: Why aren\t children of MPs not on the frontline? The majority of them live in Europe anyway. Ordinary boys are dying for no good reason. Another uses an expletive to describe President Vladimir Putin and goes on to say that by deciding to play war he has sent thousands of guys to die. For the most part though those reacting on social media remain true to the official narrative. IMAGE SOURCE INSTAGRAM Image caption The top Ukrainian comment on a post mourning Ravshan Zhakbayev reads: Everyone who steps on our soil to occupy it will get buried in it. Welcome to hell! A later comment reads: Eternal memory to you our hero our protector. Thanks for all.((( On some V\Kontakte memorial walls Ukrainians have posted comments mocking the dead men. Over 15000 have died already and they will continue on dying as long as they\ll keep on marching on our land. Nobody invited you freaking saviours reads one. Alexander go away you bloody Nazi a Russian responds to another mocking post. Our soldiers are real heroes. Russians have never killed civilians nor children which is something you can\t say about Ukrainians. The fury of those online exchanges is nothing though to the experiences of the VDV forces who have been hit by Ukrainian artillery ambushes and infantry assaults during weeks of bloody combat. In these close-quarter battles they have discovered what earlier VDV units learned in Afghanistan - that armoured vehicles designed to be light enough to be carried on planes do not give much protection from enemy fire. From the roads outside Hostomel airfield to a side street in Bucha or a road junction in Irpin videos taken by Ukrainians have shown burnt out and abandoned vehicles belonging to the airborne group. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter These scraps of phone footage also speak to a more basic failure. In these shattered neighbourhoods around Kyiv the Russian paratroopers were outmatched by the Ukrainians. And given that the defenders were in many cases simply local defence units or reservists that speaks to a basic failure in the VDVs system of training and recruitment. Ukrainians have latched on to the 331st\s losses making excited claims that the regiment has been wiped out. Ilya Ponamarev a former Russian MP and opposition figure who now lives in Kyiv says people there see the regiment\s fate as a perfect example of karma. During the 2014 fighting in the Donbas the 331st was held responsible by Ukrainians for killing hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers at Ilovaisk in breach of a ceasefire agreement. However while the regiment has suffered considerably Ukrainian claims that they have been wiped out are an exaggeration. It is likely though that the 331st Parachute Regiment may have been withdrawn from Ukraine recently - certainly unidentified elements of the VDV task force to which it belonged were filmed on 29 March pulling back into Belarus. Image caption Photographs of some of the Russian soldiers from the 331 regiment who have died As for the price of failure it mounts daily. At the time of writing BBC Newsnight had compiled a list of 39 named members of the 331st Parachute Regiment killed in Ukraine. But since none of those fatalities is more recent than the 13 March it can be supposed that dozens more will emerge in the coming weeks. Kostroma locals have told us they believe that around 100 members of the regiment may have died. And many families will never receive their loved ones body because it was left behind on the battlefield. Even a conservative projection of the deaths we now know about and their dates suggest that the towns losses in a few weeks in Ukraine already exceed those from the conflicts in Afghanistan and Chechnya. The regiment that set off full of confidence in February has acquired the type of reputation that no soldiers would ever want.

Our correspondent Jeremy Bowen counted 13 bodies on one small stretch of highway where just hours earlier Russian forces had been in control. We know who two of the dead were: a Ukrainian father and mother who had been fleeing to the capital with their daughter and an elderly woman. We know this because their deaths - as he put his hands up in surrender trying desperately to stop Russian forces firing on the car they were travelling in - were caught on camera by a drone. In other places along the road attempts had been made to cover up the bodies. Our correspondent says we dont know what happened to these people but a credible working assumption for any investigation must be that the other dead people were killed by either the tank crew seen in the drone video or other Russian soldiers. The drone footage has been handed to the authorities for investigation. There have been numerous allegations of war crimes made since the start of the invasion in February and both the UN and the International Criminal Court are looking into them. Read Jeremy Bowens full report into what he and his team found here Russia accuses Ukraine of striking oil depot on its territory IMAGE SOURCE RUSSIAN EMERGENCIES MINISTRY/REUTERS Image caption Several fuel tanks are ablaze Russian media report Russia accused Ukraine of being responsible for a huge fire at an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod. Russian officials said two Ukrainian military helicopters had crossed the border from Ukraine and fired missiles at the facility. Vyacheslav Gladkov governor of the Russian city of Belgorod some 40km (25 miles) from the border said the early morning rocket attack left eight fuel tanks ablaze. Initial statements from Ukraine would neither confirm nor deny that - but later in the day the secretary of Ukraine\s security council Oleksiy Danilov said the Russian version of events does not correspond to reality. But if it is true that Ukraine mounted the attack our defence correspondent Jonathan Beale notes it would mark the first time that Ukrainian aircraft have flown into Russian airspace to hit a target bringing the war home to Russia. And it isnt impossible: the skills needed - flying low and fast to avoid detection - are ones Ukrainian pilots have been honing in recent years as the country battled separatists in the east.

Evacuation team fails to reach Mariupol IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS A Red Cross team which had hoped to make it to the besieged city of Mariupol to help with an evacuation effort was forced to turn back after arrangements and conditions made it impossible to proceed. The team of nine from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had been hoping to help evacuate some of the thousands of residents still trapped in the coastal city large parts of which have been destroyed in the fighting. The regional governor has accused Russia of breaking a promise to allow a humanitarian corridor out of Mariupol. The ICRC said it will try again on Saturday. It had initially been planned for Thursday. Whats happening in the east? Moscow has begun shifting its attention from the capital and the north in general trying instead to encircle Ukraines forces in the east of the country. Its army is moving south taking control of the city of Izyum and bombarding a succession of towns to the east. Eventually it hopes to move further south still to the town of Slovyansk. But what is it that Russia wants with this region known as the Donbas? On paper at least the aim is to liberate its Russian-speaking majority. The question remains: can Moscows forces defeat the Ukrainian army here and - crucially - do the people of this former coal and steel-producing region want to be liberated? As the BBCs Paul Kirby has been finding out a shared language may not be enough to win the regions loyalty.

India has not joined the widespread condemnation of Russias invasion and is a major buyer of Russian arms. But it faces a diplomatic balancing act and is under pressure from Western countries to help rein in Russia. Following the talks India said it favoured peaceful resolutions of conflicts but did not criticise Russia. India which is a nuclear power has a long history of pursuing a non-aligned strategy in international politics not tying itself to the interests of other superpowers or political blocs. Russia\s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov - who also met Indian\s Prime Minister Narendra Modi - spoke of the friendship between the two nations in his statement. These days our Western colleagues would like to reduce any meaningful international issue to the crisis in Ukraine he said. We] appreciate that India is taking this situation in the entirety of facts not just in a one-sided way. Russia has justified invading Ukraine as a means to demilitarise and de-Nazify its neighbour an argument widely dismissed by the West as a baseless pretext for invasion. Mr Lavrov\s Indian counterpart S Jaishankar emphasised the importance of cessation of violence and ending hostilities. Differences and disputes should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy and by respect for international law the] UN Charter sovereignty and territorial integrity of states India\s foreign ministry said.

FUEL: Could the world cope without Russian oil? READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis India needs Russian military hardware as deterrence against China with which it was involved in a deadly border clash with in 2020. China too has stopped short of condemning Russias actions in Ukraine. The US chief sanctions strategist Daleep Singh alluded to Russia-China ties when he warned India that Russia would not be a reliable ally ahead of the foreign ministers meeting. Russia is going to be the junior partner in this relationship with China. And the more leverage that China gains over Russia the less favourable that is for India he said. India stepped up purchases of Russia oil after prices slumped in the wake of Western sanctions. On Thursday UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she respected India\s decision to continue to buy oil but also urged like-minded nations to co-operate more closely on defence trade and energy and food security. In recent weeks theres been a conveyor belt of visiting dignitaries and diplomats whove come to India from the UK US China Japan Germany Austria Mexico Nepal and Greece. It seems as if every nation wants to get India on side - but India is resolutely staying neutral. Delhi prides itself on its independent foreign policy yet its ties with Russia run deep and are also practical - it buys the vast majority of its weapons from Moscow. The visit by Russias Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was a clear signal that India still sees Russia as an ally even if many world leaders view it as an aggressor. Prime Minister Modi even took time to meet Sergei Lavrov himself - contrast that to British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Chinas Foreign Minister Wang Yi both recent visitors who didnt get an audience. Indias relationship with Russia and its diplomatic balancing act could turn it into an unexpected broker. Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was open to India mediating in the crisis while a statement from Prime Minister Modis office said hed conveyed Indias readiness to contribute in any way to the peace efforts.]Why Russia is trying to encircle Ukraine's east,"Russia has shifted most of the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine, aiming to ""liberate"" the region.",Why Russia is trying to encircle Ukraines east By Paul Kirby BBC News Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Russian troops now control large areas of the east but Ukraine has vowed to fight for every last metre Russia has shifted most of the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine after a series of setbacks especially around the capital Kyiv. This push into the area known as Donbas could signal a more prolonged conflict says the US. What would Vladimir Putin need before he could claim his goal of liberating Ukraine\s old industrial heart and is that possible? Russian forces have already triggered a humanitarian catastrophe in the east reducing Mariupol to ruins but they have failed to inflict defeat on Ukraine\s military. Warning of a new onslaught on the east President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed: We will fight for every metre of our land. Ukraine had already stationed its best-trained forces in the east because of an eight-year war with Russian-backed separatists. They are thought to have suffered heavy losses but are still a significant challenge to Russias invading army. What is Ukraines Donbas? When President Putin talks of Donbas he is referring to Ukraines old coal and steel-producing area. But he really means the entirety of two big eastern regions Luhansk and Donetsk which run from outside Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border. The key is that it has been identified by the Kremlin as a Russian-speaking part of Ukraine that is more Russia than Ukraine says Sam Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute. These areas may be broadly Russian-speaking but they are no longer pro-Russian. Mariupol was one of the most pro-Russian cities in Ukraine and to level it is beyond my comprehension says defence specialist Konrad Muzyka head of Rochan Consulting. Last week Russia claimed to have taken control of 93% of Luhansk region and 54% of Donetsk. Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukraines army in the east. They have taken control of Izyum - a strategic town on the road between Ukraines second city Kharkiv and the separatist areas - and have bombarded a succession of Luhansk towns including Rubizhne Lysychansk Popasna and Severodonetsk destroying blocks of flats and killing civilians in their homes. The towns that are now in Russian sights have already experienced years of war since 2014 and barely a day goes by now without a deadly attack. Civilians are being moved out ahead of the Russian advance. Local leader Serhiy Haidai said 20 children were led to safety from the basement of a kindergarten in Lysychansk on Thursday and some 200 civilians climbed on to buses in Severodonetsk. IMAGE SOURCE SERHIY HAIDAI/LUHANSK OVA Image caption More than 200 people were evacuated from Severodonetsk on Thursday They were leaving for western Ukraine with nothing said Mr Haidai but they were alive. Maryna Agafonova 27 fled her family\s home in Lysychansk earlier this week. At the start of the war she said Russian forces had targeted the outskirts of the town but had lately hit the centre. They attacked hospitals and residential buildings. There is no heating and no electricity. My parents are still there. Ukrainian forces were still holding out there in numbers she told the BBC: They don\t let the Russians occupy it. Russias next aim will be to push south to encircle Slovyansk a city of 125000 people that already experienced war at close hand when it was seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014 before being recaptured. War in Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine WAR CRIMES: Gruesome evidence on road to Kyiv YOUR QUESTIONS: Could Ukraine win the war? FUEL: Could the world cope without Russian oil? READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Why Putin wants to control Donbas The Russian leader has repeatedly made the unfounded accusation that Ukraine has carried out genocide in the east. When the war began two-thirds of the eastern regions were in Ukrainian hands. The rest was run by separatists who created Russian-backed statelets during a war that began eight years ago. If Russia were to conquer both big regions then the next step could be to annexe them too just like it did with Crimea in 2014. Before invading Ukraine President Putin recognised the entirety of the two eastern regions as independent of Ukraine. The Russian puppet leader in Luhansk has already spoken of a referendum in the near future although the idea of even a sham vote taking place in a war zone seems absurd. Scary existence in separatist Luhansk Life under the control of Russian-backed separatists is quieter although separatist authorities have accused Ukrainian forces of shelling residential buildings and killing civilians. Officials in the Donetsk statelet say 72 civilians have died since mid-February. One woman in Luhansk told the BBC on condition of anonymity that she had seen a lot of Russian military armour in the city and the atmosphere now was one of fear and caution. I\m scared - it\s just scary she said. Men of military age were required to join the local militia so anyone who avoided the draft was in hiding she explained. They\re mobilising men] on the streets catching them. There are no men in the shops in town on the streets. As a result all male-dominated businesses are shut she said. We\re already Russia although just informally. Everyone has a Russian passport. Will Ukraines forces hold out? At the start of the war the 10 brigades that made up the Joint Forces Operation (JFO) in the east were regarded as the best-equipped and best-trained soldiers that Ukraine has. We don\t really know the strength of Ukrainian forces now said Sam Cranny-Evans of Rusi who believes their numbers will have been boosted by volunteers in recent weeks. Russian forces have already sustained high losses after more than five weeks of conflict and morale is thought to be low. They are made up of men enlisted from the local separatist areas as well as the broader Russian army. However they have seized a considerable part of the south-east and will hope to control the entire stretch of coastal territory from Crimea to the Russian border. The main goal for the Ukrainians is to incur as big losses on the Russian side as possible and the Ukrainians are using asymmetric tactics to avoid big battles says Konrad Muzyka. One man called Mykyta who managed to flee the Russian bombardment of Mariupol said he was confident the Ukrainian army would succeed in fighting back. Some day they will return our cities the Azov battalion will not surrender Mariupol he told the BBC. The Ukrainian army is very cunning I didn\t see them in my city but I heard them they are very good at disguise.]Ukraine war: Polish doctor saves family's sight after bombing,The mother of five-year-old twin boys describes how she tried to protect as their house was bombed.,Ukraine war: Polish doctor saves familys sight after bombing By Kasia Madera BBC News Lublin Poland Published 1 hour ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war I went into the kitchen and saw a bomb coming towards my window. It was all so quick I didn\t know what was happening. I just saw it flying towards me. It was the morning of 11 March in the eastern Ukrainian region of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast when a bomb crashed into Olena Selichzianowas home - and her family. Speaking in Russian the mother of five-year-old twin boys Nazar and Timur describes how she fell to her knees pulling her sons beneath her to protect them from the pieces of shrapnel. After the bombs impact she recalls nothing. All three were blinded by the flying fragments that cut into their arms and faces. Their skin was badly burned a small shard of glass embedded itself in one of Olenas eyes and her leg was broken. Image caption Nazar and Timur have had several surgeries to try to save their sight The family were pulled from the wreckage and taken to a nearby hospital but their wounds were so serious they had to be moved quickly. In Lviv eye specialist Dr Nataliya Preys was made aware of this familys injuries. Dr Preys sent images of the wounds to her former teacher in Poland Professor Robert Rejdak at the Medical University of Lublin. He knew the three needed to be treated immediately. But the fighting in Ukraine meant it would take a week for Olena Nazar and Timur to reach Poland. A little bit of a miracle They have come from hell Professor Rejdak told us. The mum was completely blind she could only reach out to touch her children. The children were so hungry and tired when they first arrived that they only ate slept and cried. He is visibly moved as he recounts their first meeting. Then his expertise as a leading surgeon at one of Europes largest eye hospitals takes over. We decided to operate on mum. I performed bilateral cataract surgery. The surgery was really complicated because of the wounds because of a piece of glass inside one eye. Fortunately the surgery went really perfectly and Olena sees almost fully two days after. The healing process is perfect so I hope it will be even better - but at least now she can see her boys and look around. A journey out of Ukraine in real time Familys bid to reach safety ends in tragedy The little boys journey to health will take longer. Nazar has lost his eye. Professor Rejdaks team performed retina surgery and is now planning further cataract surgery. The twins also have really massive ocular trauma he says. We are hoping the vision will be good but they need longer treatment. If Olena and her boys had reached Lublin just a few days later the consequences would have been stark. They would be blind because it was the last moment to start the treatment it already took seven days from the accident and in ocular trauma time is crucial. When asked if it was a miracle to be able to save their sight Professor Rejdak says a little bit. Jumpy and struggling to sleep Back on the ward the little boys are playing. Although it is Nazar who has lost his eye he seems more protective over his brother Timur who is a little shyer and more withdrawn. A psychologist is helping them giving them tablets so they can sleep explains Olena. They are feeling better and have had many operations. But they saw the bomb fall on them. They are a little calmer but they are jumpy and they struggle to sleep. Before the war Olena was a cook at the local school. Once her family have healed would she want to go back? No she answers quickly. Everyone has been so kind here I want to stay. Also my home has been destroyed there is nothing left. Professor Rejdak is among those helping to find somewhere for this family to live. Once Olena has recovered and only when she is ready the hope is she that she will find a job. This is not the only family that needs help. Professor Rejdak is providing virtual consultations with his colleagues in Ukraine. Thanks to his teaching work he has a network of specialists. He works closely with his former pupil Dr Preys and advises who should be evacuated to receive surgery in Lublin. Image caption Professsor Rejdak is preparing for more people arriving from Ukraine If evacuation is not possible then he gives advice on how doctors in Lviv should proceed with treatment. He firmly believes virtual medicine is key to helping the victims of this war. Medical supplies and donations are also being sent to Ukraine by a team of people brought together under the umbrella of the Medical University of Lublin. The work is endless as more and more people are injured in the fighting. Professor Rejdak and his team will be operating on the twins again in the coming days but they are also preparing for new arrivals who will be coming to the hospital from Ukraine.

Gruesome evidence points to war crimes on road to Kyiv How do Russians get news about the war in Ukraine? Could Ukraine win the war? And other questions After a long wait their visas were approved on Wednesday but Ms Radford was critical of the process. She was particularly upset that child applicants had to answer questions about terrorist affiliations and military history. They\ve treated what are primarily women and children as threats first rather than people to help she said. That\s not to say that if it was men it would be different - maybe it would maybe it wouldn\t. But it\s women and kids... I had to answer for a four-year-old: \Are you a terrorist? Have you ever been in the armed forces?\ Why are you asking those questions? It should literally just be: \Are you a child? Who is your mum? OK we\ll sort you out when you\re here and we can have questions with you then if we need to.\ IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption The 39-year-old hoped the family would fly to the UK on Friday Ms Radford said her wife whose name she asked to be withheld found the British visa application difficult. She said that the Polish people have been wonderful but as soon as she interacted with British bureaucracy she felt terrible which is really hard for me to hear as a British person Ms Radford said. She hopes her Ukrainian relatives will be able to fly to the UK on later to join she and her wife in Sheffield. A government spokesperson said: We are moving as quickly as possible to ensure that those fleeing Ukraine can find safety in the UK through the Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine. We continue to speed up visa processing across both schemes with 25500 visas issued in the last three weeks alone and thousands more expected to come through these uncapped routes. While we have streamlined the process simplified our forms and boosted case worker numbers vital security checks are needed to protect our borders and the British people from hostile state actors from Russia who would cynically take advantage of the support we are rightly providing to people fleeing Ukraine.

If applications are approved it would allow about 150 people to live in the county for up to three years. But the council said due to specific challenges with the plan there was still uncertainty about how many would eventually arrive. It comes as a community welcome fund has raised more than £30000 to help. The Homes for Ukraine scheme allows people to host refugees who dont have family ties in the UK with households offered £350 a month for up to 12 months. It was introduced after the government was criticised for not doing enough but critics have called the process too slow and bureaucratic. I sat in class wondering if my parents were dead How can I offer a UK home to Ukrainian refugees?

The moment came two or three days after the first Russian forces crossed into Ukraine on 24 February when Ukrainian forces destroyed a column of Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers moving through the town of Bucha to the city of Kyiv. The convoy was destroyed in one of the first of many Ukrainian ambushes that stopped the Russian advance dead. Our BBC team was able to get to Bucha because during Friday the final Russian soldiers pulled out as part of what the Kremlin has presented as a calm and rational decision to concentrate on the war in eastern Ukraine. Moscow says without proof or any reliability that its war aims in central Ukraine have been achieved and they never included capturing Kyiv. The truth is that unexpectedly fierce and well organised Ukrainian resistance stopped them outside the capital and the evidence includes the rusting and twisted wreckage of the column that still lies where it was destroyed on that suburban street. IMAGE SOURCE BBC/KATHY LONG Image caption Local residents say they hadnt had any bread for weeks Two or three weeks into the war the Russian invaders ran out of momentum. On the street in Bucha you can see why. Elite troops from Russias airborne forces rode into the town in armoured vehicles light enough to be carried by aircraft. They came from Hostomel airport a few miles away which had been attacked and seized by Russian paratroopers landed by helicopter on the first day of the invasion. Even then there was fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces. When the column moved through Bucha on the way to Kyiv they had a harsh awakening. The road is narrow and straight an ideal place for an ambush. Witnesses said the Ukrainians attacked the convoy with Bayraktar attack drones bought from Turkey. Other neighbours said Ukrainian territorial defence volunteers were also in the area. However they did it the lead vehicles and the ones bringing up the rear were knocked out and imprisoned the others. The wreckage has not been touched. Belts of 30mm cannon shells lie on the grass verge along with many pieces of dangerous and damaged abandoned ordnance. Young conscripts ran away begging local people said not to be turned over to Ukrainian territorial defence. A man of around 70 who called himself uncle Hrysha said: I felt sorry for them. They were so young 18 to 20 with their whole lives ahead of them. It looks as if Russians as they prepared to pull out of Bucha had no such pity. At least 20 dead men were lying in the street as Ukrainian troops entered the town. Some of them had their hands tied behind their backs. The mayor said they had buried 280 people in mass graves. A few civilians who stayed said they had tried to avoid the Russians. They set up wood fires outside their Khrushchev-era flats cooking on them outdoors because their gas power and water were cut. Volunteers are bringing supplies in from Lviv in western Ukraine and from countries far from the war geographically at least. This is the first bread we\ve had in 38 days said a woman called Maria looking at a plastic bag with some modest looking buns inside. Her daughter Larysa showed me round the Soviet-built apartment building. Many of the people who had left for safer areas or abroad had bolted shut security doors. The Russians removed them by ripping out the concrete lintels and door posts. IMAGE SOURCE BBC/KATHY LONG Image caption Doors ripped off in a Bucha apartment block A few miles away the trail of devastation leads to Hostomel airport. Russian airborne troops tried to use it as a base for a push into Kyiv. The worlds largest transport plane was destroyed early on. The roof of the enormous hangar built for it was so riddled with a constellation of shrapnel holes. The plane itself known by the Ukrainian word for dream (Mriya) lies there broken-backed big chunks of fuselage and engine in places around it. Its fate is a parable of what is happening to Ukraine. An enormous amount of national pride was invested in the aircraft as a symbol of Ukraines ability make big projects all round the world.

At least that\s what countless European politicians and commentators say since Russian President Vladimir Putin began his invasion of Ukraine. Are they right? Yes and No Id argue. Starting with the Yes. On 24 February President Putin shocked this continent out of complacency. His assault on Ukraine has brought large-scale death and destruction back to Europe including whispers of possible nuclear war. His aim: not only to dominate Ukraine but to roll back Western dominance militarily and - ideally - politically in terms of liberal democracy from the former Soviet sphere of influence. The action Western allies take together now will fundamentally affect Europeans sense of self and safety for years to come. Nato is re-invigorated. The transatlantic military alliance once dismissed by French President Emmanuel Macron as brain dead is simultaneously proving Mr Putin wrong to view the West as weak and disunited while also providing military support defence and deterrence to Nato\s eastern flank that feels so exposed to the Kremlin\s expansionist fervour. This - so far - is also proving to be a defining moment for the EU. The bloc had long talked up playing a bigger role on the world stage - and not solely in terms of economics and trade. Until now that was a failed ambition. But the Russia-Ukraine crisis has unexpectedly elevated the EU into a credible geopolitical player. The speed with which Brussels co-ordinated sanctions against Russia - both within the EU and with international allies - was frankly impressive. As were the unity of resolve amongst member states and the bureaucracy-defying EU moves to enact never-before-used mechanisms to help Ukrainian refugees and the Ukrainian military. Germany one of the EUs biggest players also took the worlds breath away by suddenly saying goodbye to World War Two sensitivities and announcing huge investments in its military the Bundeswehr. Key to the decision being applauded in the EU and further afield is that this is not a Germany newly flexing nationalist muscles. This is about Germany helping to re-define Europe not its own role Ricarda Lang told me. She is the co-chair of the German Green Party in the coalition government. It\s about European sovereignty not just in security and defence but also in terms of imports and energy. For years Germany has knowingly been reliant on the US for security and on Russia for energy and trade. It is not the only EU country in that position. But as the blocs richest and most powerful nation Berlin is the most stand-out example. And this has weakened the Wests hand when it comes to sanctions against Russia. EU countries pay Moscow up to €800m (£674m; $884m) for energy every day which amounts to an estimated 40% of the Kremlins income. This money goes towards funding the war against Ukraine that the West is ostensibly fighting. It\s tragic it took a war like this but now we Germans have woken up with a bang! insists Marie Agnes Strack-Zimmerman who heads the German parliament\s Defence Committee. She assured me Berlin was now ready to take responsibility. Image caption We Germans have woken up with a bang! said the chairwoman of the German parliaments Defence Committee The West looked at Germany with suspicion after two world wars she observed but that was decades ago and - to be honest she said - Germany was pretty comfortable enjoying being a Nato and EU member without having to invest in its own army. Germany\s allies have waited too long for us to do our bit. Berlin has now pledged to build an efficient modern military and to keep up defence spending to Nato requirements. Under international pressure trade and energy ties are being tackled too. Bear in mind though that transforming the currently threadbare German military will take years as will untangling the country from its deep-seated relations with Russia. For decades Berlin was the dividing line between East and West Europe. Hopes for European unity were high after the fall of the iconic Berlin Wall and the ensuing 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union. But fast-forward 30 years and you hear talk of a new Berlin Wall though further to the east. Tiny Baltic country Latvia has a 200km (124 mile)-long border fence separating the EU and Nato member on one side from expansionist Russia on the other. Col Sandris Gaugers is the commander of the Latvian Land Forces Mechanized Infantry Brigade. We spoke at his military base just outside the capital Riga. The base is also home to Nato forces which have almost doubled in size since Russia invaded Ukraine. Image caption Col Sandris Gaugers said priorities have changed across Europe I see a new Iron Curtain coming. Though this time we\ll be on the western side the colonel told me. We are living a new reality. For us Latvians the security environment is now gone. We spent 20 years in Iraq in Afghanistan. Now our main focus is here. How do we defend our freedom and our country? Priorities have now changed across Europe he said. People used to focus on economic wealth. Now it\s about defending our values and way of life. Latvians and their Baltic neighbours in Estonia and Lithuania are trying hard not to say I-told-you-so to the West. They\ve been warning about President Putin for years. They feel they understand the Russian leader better than most. All three countries were once part of the Soviet Union. Latvia\s Prime Minister Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš insists the West has to accept that Putin is not like us. France and German leaders famously went on diplomatic visits to Moscow earlier this year trying to dissuade President Putin from attacking Ukraine. Prime Minister Kariņš says agonising over finding the right words or turns of phrase to persuade Mr Putin is pointless. He\s hell-bent on destroying democracy and our way of life. If we don\t stop Putin. He will not stop at Ukraine. Mr Kariņš said the one good thing to come out of the current situation is that Nato and the EU are working closer together than they have in 30 years. That he said was a game-changer. And here we come back to whether this is an era-defining moment for Europe. Or maybe not. The EU is thrilled to have the US back and engaged in Europe. For all Brussels\ talk of the bloc now building strategic sovereignty in defence and security EU countries look to Washington when faced with Russian threats. Image caption Training session at the Adazi military base in Latvia EU defence plans designed to complement - or to partly replace - Nato depending which European politician you speak to are nothing new. And so far theyve never worked. All EU countries agree that at the very least it makes sense to pool resources and know-how: cyber military equipment and intelligence. Yet no nation wants to go first. Each EU member has businesses or individuals benefiting from national contracts. The European Commission now wants to oversee the overhaul of defence capabilities. Few in the military are holding their breath wherever they reside in Europe. As regards the renaissance in EU-Nato co-operation in all likelihood once the acute Russia-Ukraine crisis subsides the US will turn its attention to what it truly sees as its foreign policy priority: the Asia-Pacific not Europe. But the EU has its raison dêtre back. Designed originally as a peace project its vision fell by the wayside in recent times. Younger Europeans had no memory of war. They saw no urgency in uniting or fighting for peace on their continent. In that regard this moment really is a new reality.

An AFP news agency reporter in Bucha near Kyiv counted at least 20 bodies. At least one man had his hands tied. Ukrainian forces regained control of the town this week and photos show widespread devastation. BBC journalists in another part of Ukraine found the bodies of two civilians killed by Russian forces. Warning: Some readers may find content in this story distressing including a photo lower down. Earlier this week the BBCs Jeremy Bowen and his team counted a total of 13 bodies some of whom may have been Ukrainian soldiers along a stretch of road between the villages of Mria and Myla. Ukraine says Russian forces have made a rapid retreat from around Kyiv with one official saying the whole region around the capital has been retaken since the invasion began on 24 February. The invasion has seen thousands killed in ferocious fighting and has made refugees of at least four million Ukrainians. Western states have responded with tough sanctions against Russia and military supplies for Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought to justify his attack by arguing that Ukraine a former Soviet state with Nato and EU ambitions was a constant threat and Russia could not feel safe develop and exist. In Bucha where a photographer for Reuters news agency also recorded dead bodies holes gaped from apartment blocks hit by shelling and crushed cars littered the streets. Sixteen of the 20 bodies seen by AFP lay either on the pavement or by the verge. Three were sprawled in the middle of the road and another lay on his side in the courtyard of a destroyed house. An open Ukrainian passport lay on the ground next to the person who had his hands tied behind his back with a piece of white cloth. Two other people had white cloth tied around their upper arms. Warning: There is a photo below that some readers may find distressing A Ukrainian official told AFP the dead men could have been killed in a bombardment or shot by Russian soldiers and police would investigate. But the towns mayor Anatoly Fedoruk told AFP by phone that all of the 20 dead had been shot in the back of the head. He added that other bodies still lay inside the wrecks of cars destroyed by shelling. The town he said had buried 280 people in mass graves as a result of the Russian invasion.

This white car turns but then stops. A man steps out and raises his hands. Then his body falls to the ground. Moments later Russian soldiers approach. An elderly woman and child leave the car and a soldier walks them away. The man on the ground was Maksim Iovenko. The 31-year-old was shot dead by Russian forces that were positioned at the roadside. His wife Ksenia who was in the car was also killed. Their six-year-old son and the elderly friend of the family who were with them escaped although she was wounded and remains in hospital. (Both families asked us not to name them.) Until I saw the video I still had some hope Maksim\s father Sergiy Iovenko tells the BBC in Kyiv where he lives. I was hoping that he was alive. The incident happened on 7 March when Maksim and his family joined a convoy of about 10 cars of civilians trying to reach Kyiv from the western outskirts of the city which had become a conflict zone. It was filmed by a Ukrainian territorial defence group doing aerial reconnaissance and widely shared. Media caption Video captured by a Ukrainian aerial reconnaissance group appears to show Russian forces shooting at civilians When a friend of Maksim\s who was part of the convoy called Sergiy to tell him the news Sergiy says he immediately knew something was wrong. There was silence when he picked up the phone and eventually the friend said: Stay strong your son and daughter-in-law are gone. Maksim lived in Kyiv and worked for a travel agency which is where he and Ksenia met. Sergiy describes his son as a family man with a kind heart who liked to sing karaoke. But his biggest hobby was his family he says. He loved his son very much and this was his passion. Like many other Ukrainians Sergiy says he and his family didnt believe Russian President Vladimir Putin would invade. Once Putin did Maksim thought Kyiv would be one of the first cities to be shelled. Having discussed the situation with an old school friend Maksim and his family moved west to the friends second home or dacha on the outskirts of Kyiv not far from the E-40 highway where the shooting would happen. Maksim told his father he thought it would be quieter there. It turned out the opposite Sergiy says. While Russias main focus appeared to be on the east and south of the country Russian forces also started bombing towns and cities to the west of the capital such as Irpin Bucha and Hostomel - close to where Maksim was staying. Sergiy says he would often hear the sound of the heavy bombing from his home in Kyiv. Maksim wouldn\t say much about conditions at the dacha Sergiy says. He would say \it is quiet peaceful all is normal.\ Maksim and his friend also called Maksim would take turns patrolling the area overnight Sergiy says. Power outages and poor mobile signal meant regular contact was difficult. As the bombing continued they moved into the basement leaving only to buy food. Then on 7 March they lost all power. With no electricity heating or food Maksim Ksenia and other families staying in the area decided to return to Kyiv. They knew they risked running into Russian troops along the highway but they thought they could make it through safely. Maksim\s car was third in the convoy made up of about 50 people in total including other children. In the windows of his car he had put handwritten signs on white paper that read: Children. His friend was part of the same convoy and it was his mother who was in the car with Maksim and Ksenia and he was able to tell Sergiy what happened. When the shooting started Maksim\s car was hit. The car\s engine stalled Sergiy says. My son jumped out of the car he raised his hands and started shouting that there was a child in the car so that the child would be saved. Its not clear why the rest of the convoy fell behind the first three cars but Sergiy believes many of those driving behind turned back when they saw the cars in front turning and heard the gunshots. After the shooting Maksims body was left on the highway and Ksenias was left in the car. Maksims son and his friends mother were told by Russian soldiers to walk back along the road. When they got a safe distance from the Russian soldiers she called her husband who came to take them to safety. They returned to the dacha and were evacuated safely to Kyiv the next day.

A team of BBC journalists taken to the same stretch of road saw many burned cars and bodies. Among them was Maksims car riddled with shrapnel and reduced to a shell by fire with the burned remains of a body inside it and one on the road beside it still wearing a wedding ring.

Vladimir Putin has followed through on weeks of threats by signing a decree that foreign countries they must start paying for gas in Russian roubles or it will halt supplies. And those new rules start on Friday meaning Western nations were effectively handed a midnight deadline to comply. Nobody sells us anything for free and we are not going to do charity either - that is existing contracts will be stopped the Russian president said. Many payments for April gas deliveries are reportedly not due until later in the month so it is not thought that there is an immediate threat to supplies. It is also still unclear whether the new payment mechanism set out by Russia would fully ban euros. But France and Germany condemned Mr Putin\s demands as being akin to blackmail. Western companies and governments have previously rejected Russias demands to pay for gas in roubles as a breach of existing contracts which are set in euros or US dollars. Yet the EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia and there is no ready-to-go replacement. Notably the EU did not enact sanctions on Russian fuel supplies - even though other Western nations such as the US and Canada did. Mr Putins demand to be paid in roubles is widely seen as an attempt to boost the currency which has been hit by the wide range of international sanctions that followed the invasion of Ukraine.

Most Russian troops leaving Chernobyl Ukraine says IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Many Russian troops occupying the former nuclear power plant at Chernobyl have left Ukraines state nuclear operator has said. Energoatom said two columns of Russian forces had set off towards the Belarusian border on Thursday morning leaving just a few soldiers at the site. Several days ago the mayor of Slavutych a nearby town housing workers at the plant announced that Russian troops had also left the town. The withdrawal follows reports that some Russian soldiers are being treated for radiation poisoning in Belarus after spending time in the most contaminated part of the Chernobyl exclusion zone. The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was investigating the report. Russias occupation of the site since 24 February the day of the invasion has been dogged with concerns about power outages and problems for the staff many of whom were trapped there for weeks and could not get home. It is the site of what is considered to be the worlds worst nuclear accident in 1986 and while no longer a working power station Chernobyl still requires constant management. Russia redeploying not retreating Troops leaving some occupied areas might sound like a win for Ukraine but Western intelligence warns that Russia is redeploying rather than retreating. Russia is trying to regroup resupply and reinforce Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said. Russia said earlier this week that it was planning to radically reduce its military activity in some places - such as near the capital Kyiv or the city of Chernihiv - and concentrate on the eastern Donbas region. Shelling continues on cities including those Russia suggested it would reduce its assault on but Mr Stoltenberg said Nato can see Russia re-positioning troops. Echoing Mr Stoltenberg\s remarks the UK\s Defence Secretary warned that Russia\s change in tactics was not a retreat and that it was changing its focus after its first efforts were rebutted.

One resident of the city Yevgen described the humanitarian disaster civilians have faced to the BBC. It was constant bombing he said. Planes went past every 10 minutes and dropped bombs on Mariupol. People were falling and dying in front of my eyes. We buried people in gardens.

And other questions,BBC reporters Jenny Hill and Orla Guerin - on the ground - answer your questions about the war in Ukraine.,Could Ukraine win the war? And other questions Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Russia continues to face fierce resistance from Ukraine more than a month into its invasion. Ukrainian forces have begun attempts to retake some areas from Russia which said this week it would scale back operations around Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv. Meanwhile four million people have fled Ukraine and a quarter of the countrys population is thought to be displaced. Two of the BBCs reporters on the ground answer your questions. Orla Guerin is in Kyiv Ukraines capital Jenny Hill is in the Russian capital Moscow In light of the recent counter-attacks that Ukraine has undertaken and assuming that diplomatic talks between Ukraine and Russia fail is it possible that Ukraine may be able to win this war militarily? - Harry Tinsley Orla Guerin writes: In military terms its a case of so far so good for Ukraine. It has surprised President Putin and the world by mounting skilled and stubborn resistance against a larger better equipped army. Equally Russian forces have surprised the world by being disorganised and inept. We saw an example of Ukraines success in battle at a frontline position outside Kyiv last week. Ukrainian forces told us the Russians had tried to break through four times in the past month and each time had been held back. The evidence was there in the form of about a half dozen burnt-out Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers. Russias invasion is now in its sixth week and it has failed on the key fronts - the Russians have not managed to enter the capital Kyiv to topple the government or to take any major city - bar Kherson - in the south. Russia has destroyed more than it has captured. Thats a poor return on a costly invasion. That said its too early to predict the outcome here. We may be at the start of a long war. Russia says it will focus now on the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. It may have little choice having failed to make gains elsewhere. But in the future it could resume trying to capture more territory elsewhere. Mr Putins fate is probably tied to the success or failure of the invasion. He may continue to pour in troops and armour and heavy weapons over the longer term. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption A destroyed Russian tank in Trostyanets Ukraine. With Russia recruiting from the Middle East does this show a lack of confidence in the quality of its own forces? - David Carter Jenny Hill writes: The Kremlin would never admit to it but there is evidence that at least some of the Russian troops are inexperienced and unprepared for their mission. The Ministry of Defence was recently forced to admit that - contrary to Mr Putins claims - conscripts had been sent to fight in Ukraine. Moscow claims to have 16000 Middle Eastern volunteers many of whom fought against Isis in the last decade ready to join Russian troops. They may have more experience than some of their Russian counterparts and some experts say they\d probably be more skilled in the kind of urban combat necessary to take cities and towns. Some argue too that they\d be less reluctant to attack or kill Ukrainian civilians (many Russians have close ties to Ukraine and consider the people there to be brethren) and that they have a reputation for brutality which could have a psychological effect on Ukrainian troops. The Kremlin presumably knows all this which is why it was so keen to publicise its access to Middle Eastern fighters - even though it has not yet officially confirmed that it will actually send them in. To what extent will unexploded ordnance remain an issue for Ukraine after the war? Is there potential for large areas of land to be deemed inaccessible as a result? - Robbie Orla Guerin writes: Sadly yes as so often in conflict the danger to human life will remain long after the guns eventually fall silent. The danger comes not only from unexploded ordnance but also from landmines. They can kill for years to come unless and until demining organisations can clear frontline areas. I have seen these organisations at work after other wars. Their work is painstaking and time-consuming. Before the invasion began there was already a war raging in the east of the country between Russian-backed separatists and the government of Ukraine. It began in 2014 and has dragged on ever since. While reporting from frontlines there in late January and February we had to carefully skirt many minefields. At that time the snow was melting - turning the soil to mud. In these conditions mines can easily shift from their original location (which may have been marked on maps or fenced off). Currently in the commuter town of Irpin north of Kyiv the Ukrainian army says there is a high risk to life because of mines in the streets. Is it getting more or less likely that the people in Russia will overthrow Mr Putin or cause greater civil unrest the longer the conflict lasts? - Damien Fieldhouse Somerset Jenny Hill writes: Less likely. The Kremlin comes down hard on those who oppose the war and many Russians who think that way have fled. What were almost daily street protests have dwindled. State opinion polls have to be viewed with some cynicism but they consistently show majority (and growing) support for Mr Putin and for his special military operation. Given that most independent Russian media outlets have been blocked or forced to close there are few alternatives to state media which sticks to the Kremlin narrative. That says that Russian troops have only gone into Ukraine to defend the Russian-speaking population from attacks and genocide perpetrated by Ukrainian nationalists and neo-Nazis. If you only watched state TV you might well conclude that this is indeed an honourable and necessary operation to save Russian speakers and Russia itself from an aggressive Ukraine which with the help of America is developing biological weapons and is desperate to get its hands on nuclear ones. Sanctions are starting to have a noticeable effect with prices rising but the Kremlin frames this as another example of Western aggression. At this stage its hard to see any public dissatisfaction evolving into revolution. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Who is going to pay to rebuild the damage inflicted on infrastructure in Ukraine - never mind the human cost? - Steve Sandercott Rugby Orla Guerin writes: The greatest cost is the human one and that is increasing by the day. The verified civilian death toll according to the United Nations is about 1200 people but the real number will be far higher. Add to this the fact that four million Ukrainians have had to flee and become refugees in other countries. There is also extensive physical destruction in cities and towns across this vast country. Nowhere has suffered more than Mariupol in the south where we spent 10 days in the countdown to the invasion. At that point it was a bustling port city with trendy cafes busy restaurants and families strolling in the parks. Satellite imagery of Mariupol now shows mostly scorched earth with 90% of residential buildings damaged or destroyed. As many as 5000 people are known to have been killed in this city alone according to Ukrainian officials. They say the actual death toll could be twice that. Ukraine\s President Volodymyr Zelensky has promised to restore every house every street and every city. He says Russia will have to learn the word \reparations\ and pay the full cost. Ukraine will certainly want reparations to be a key part of any deal done to end the war. If Russia pays - and how much - will depend on who has the upper hand when that deal is done. Theoretically Russian assets abroad frozen by G7 countries could be used to help foot the bill. If a peace deal were to happen how would Ukraine/Russia deal with Crimea the regions taken by Russia in the Donbas this past month and the areas that have been controlled by Russian-backed rebels for the past few years? - Ryan McGauley Jenny Hill writes: We know that Mr Putin wants the world to recognise Crimea which Russia annexed in 2014 as Russian. During negotiations earlier this week the Ukrainian side suggested that Crimeas status be negotiated over 15 years as part of an overall peace deal although its hard to see Mr Putin agreeing to that. He also wants the international community to recognise (as he has) the self-proclaimed peoples\ republics of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent (although this would basically mean Russian-controlled). Given that the Kremlin\s current plan is to intensify its efforts in eastern Ukraine in order to liberate the whole Donbas region we can assume that Mr Putin intends to try to take - and hold on to - the region. Weve seen the Ukrainian military be very effective in certain areas. What prevents the military from destroying the Russian artillery that is shelling their cities? - Paul Ackrill Orla Guerin writes: Independent military experts point to one possible factor. They say Russia is firing artillery from tracked vehicles that can quickly move location once they have fired. That makes them harder to target. Ukrainian forces have told us they also are constrained because of the presence of civilians in built-up areas from which Russia is firing. They dont want to risk killing their own people while targeting Russian artillery. This has been an issue in the towns like Bucha outside Kyiv where some civilians remained despite the presence of Russian forces. Around Kyiv Ukrainian forces have managed to push back the Russians limiting the scope for them to use artillery. Because the city centre is out of reach Mr Putins men have been unable to bombard Kyiv as they have Mariupol and have resorted to air strikes. However Ukrainian air defences have been working well. Several times here in Kyiv we have heard the massive bang when a Russian missile is brought down - sometimes with casualties on the ground. In general Ukraine has been pleading for more and better air defence systems to help it curb the Russian threat. And the constant demand here is for Nato to impose a no-fly zone. We have met civilians fleeing the shelling of Irpin who pleaded for Nato to close the skies. However few here believe there is any chance of that because of Western fears of becoming embroiled in a wider war. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Ukrainian servicemen prepare for battle east of Kyiv Mr Putin has placed massive restrictions on the media in Russia but is there a possibility that news reported by Ukraine - for example the numbers of deaths of troops and civilians - is not wholly accurate? - Sarah Oxford Orla Guerin writes: Both sides are fighting an information war as well as the war on the battlefields. In any conflict information from any of the warring parties - about civilian deaths territory captured or enemy soldiers killed - has to be taken with caution. This is especially true now in relation to Russia - which is trying to ensure that its people receive only the Kremlin\s version of events. It still refuses to admit that it invaded Ukraine and refers only to its special military operation. We prioritise first-hand reporting which is why the BBC has teams in so many parts of Ukraine - gathering testimony from people on the ground including civilians medical staff local officials and the Ukrainian military. Ukraine is acknowledging that it has suffered losses and BBC teams in different cities have been able to report on the funerals of Ukrainian soldiers killed in battle. We cant know yet if the full extent of the losses is being made public. Are there any anti-war Russians? Are they safe? - Roanna Brighton Jenny Hill writes: Yes there are but its difficult to assess how widespread such dissent really is. Speaking out against the war - or even telling the truth about what Mr Putin continues to insist is only a special military operation - can result in a criminal conviction and possibly a jail sentence. Its reported that more than 15000 people were detained for taking part in almost daily street protests during the first three weeks of the invasion. Most independent journalists and many Russians who oppose the invasion have fled the country for places like Turkey Armenia and Georgia. The Kremlin calls them traitors and some of those who have stayed have become the target of abuse or attacks. We are seeing the point of view of frontline Ukrainian soldiers but is it possible to get the perspective from the Russian side? Are you prevented by the Russians from reporting on and talking to Russian troops on the ground in Ukraine? - Robert Bishops Stortford Jenny Hill writes: I cant answer for my colleagues currently in Ukraine but the Kremlin tightly controls the flow of information back to Russia. The Ministry of Defence issues frequent updates which consistently emphasise the success of the special military operation. Russian soldiers are banned from using smartphones and Moscow has made it a criminal offence to publish information which would discredit the Russian military or to spread what the Kremlin would deem to be fake news about it. An independent organisation exists which aims to help families of servicemen to get information about them. However theyve recently told us that theyre under considerable pressure from the authorities to stop their activities.

It said the items could potentially save thousands of lives while they await emergency surgery in hospital. Supplies have come from Oxfordshire Hampshire Buckinghamshire Berkshire Surrey and Sussex. Image caption All of the items loaded into the lorry will be taken further into Ukraine by humanitarian groups They were being packed by staff and volunteers on Friday at Boundary Park in Didcot. Preparations will continue on Saturday. All of the supplies will fit into a lorry and will go directly to field hospitals. Kate Ellis paramedic team leader said: SCAS has been very kind and donated items that we don\t use any more. We\re sending a huge amount of stuff to help those out in the field. Image caption The items will mean severely injured soldiers and civilians can be treated for up to 24 hours before being taken to hospital The lorries will be driven out of Oxfordshire by Ukrainian nationals on Saturday evening and will be unloaded at a depot in western Ukraine. They will then be taken further into the country by humanitarian groups. Paul Wilson from Grove is helping the effort. His Ukrainian wife Svetlana is in Poland trying to secure a UK visa for her mother who escaped her home country last week.

Traditionally the famous World War Two film theme had been played before each Lincoln City home game while the siren was sounded ahead of corner kicks. But the club and fans said they should be silenced for the rest of the season. Lincoln City claims a long association with the Dambusters 617 Squadron which was based at nearby RAF Scampton. The EFL League One side agreed the move at a supporters board meeting. Challenging matter Lincoln City FC chief executive Liam Scully said the club wanted to strike an appropriate balance between its long-standing synonymous gestures and actions. The decision was a very challenging matter to navigate and could polarise views Mr Scully said. He asked asked fans to support the move in the spirit the decision was made and said it would be reviewed at the end of the season. However Lincoln City fan Alex Webber said he did not feel that playing the Dambusters March was disrespectful. I believe the club should look at reinstating our anthem before the matches and in the second half when the teams come out he said. I can understand not using the air raid siren due to the ongoing bombing in Ukraine and how that would make people feel. IMAGE SOURCE GEOGRAPH/RICHARD CROFT Image caption Bomber crews often used Lincoln Cathedral as a landmark to guide them home Meanwhile Ben Ward who has followed Lincoln for 30 years said he thought the silence was probably fair enough given we have a large Eastern European/Ukrainian component to the population in Lincoln who will likely be on edge. He added: I think there\s been a massive overreaction to these two things. I don\t think missing a siren for four games is a decision that\s killing the club. The Dambusters 617 Squadron famously flew Lancaster bombers from RAF Scampton to destroy dams in Germanys Ruhr Valley during World War Two. Many bomber crews used Lincoln Cathedral as a landmark to let them know they had returned home safely. Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook Twitter and Instagram.

Jacquie Clayton travelled to Krakow to help out in a soup kitchen as the humanitarian crisis unfolded. There she witnessed absolutely heart-breaking scenes which convinced her to join the Homes for Ukraine scheme. And on Sunday Svitlana and Yulia Derkach arrived in Scotland to stay with Ms Clayton and her husband Colin. So far 2700 visas have been issued for refugees coming to the UK as part of the initiative - fewer than 10% of the 28300 applications made in the schemes first 15 days. Ms Clayton had been critical of the bureaucracy faced by applicants but she told BBC Scotland of her relief that Svitlana 25 and 18-year-old Yulia were finally safe. The sisters are originally from Zhytomyr a city about 120km (75 miles) west of Kyiv. They were both based in the Ukrainian capital when the Russian invasion was launched on 24 February. But their parents have stayed behind to look after elderly relatives despite the region coming under heavy bombardment. Homes for Ukraine: 2700 visas issued government reveals How to sponsor Ukrainian refugees How many people have fled Ukraine? After Ms Clayton signed up for the scheme Svitlana got in touch with her and they built up a rapport on WhatsApp. She shared pictures of her family home and Edinburgh before they met for the first time. And Ms Clayton hopes others with spare rooms in their home will do the same. She said: I think we have seen enough on TV. These people did not ask for war. This should never have happened in the 21st century. All they are looking for is sanctuary and safety. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Intense daily bombing has left many of Zhytomyrs residents homeless Svitlana believes she has found both in Scotland. She said: We are very relieved. We are happy we are safe now and our parents don\t have to worry about our safety. Svitlana was working as a paralegal when Russia launched the invasion that she never imagined was possible. She said: It was really a shock to wake up from my father\s call at 5am to say: \The war has started. Pack your things and get out of the city\. It was really hard to stay in Kyiv and very dangerous. She also had to endure the fear and uncertainty of what was unfolding in her home region where school buildings and key infrastructure have been destroyed. Since the weekend Svitlana has been overwhelmed by the welcome her and her sister have received from the Clayton family. She said: We are very happy and very lucky. I did not expect such kindness from strange people I met on the internet. Their support is unbelievable. IMAGE SOURCE DERKACH FAMILY Image caption Svitlana and Yulia Derkach with their parents in Ukraine Yulia was studying geography and English at a university in Kyiv when the conflict started. She admitted the experience of moving to a new country at a time of great uncertainty in her homeland had been stressful. But Yulia added: The moment I saw our sponsors I felt really relieved because they met us with such warmth and love and I did not expect this. Ms Clayton hopes the young women will become lifelong friends and that she will be able to one day visit them in Ukraine. In the meantime she is showing them around Edinburgh. And next week they will attend a concert by singer-songwriter Jack Savoretti at the citys Usher Hall. Ms Clayton said: I want them to have as normal a life as possible while they are here.

The previous 4.7% growth forecast has been cut to 2.5% due to the impact of the war and related policies said WTO boss Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. The cut is also linked to continuing global supply chain problems that started as a result of the pandemic. She said disruptions would make food more costly saying my worry is that we have a food crisis that is brewing. Dr Okonjo-Iweala told the BBC that although Russia and Ukraine only make up about 2.5% of global merchandise exports they are very very significant in certain sectors. The first worry of course is for the people of Ukraine who are being displaced and] not having enough food to eat she said. Ukraine war could hit global growth OECD warns Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices The economic cost of Chinas zero-Covid policy She added the global economy was going to suffer some severe consequences and said poorer countries would particularly feel the impact of the shortages and the supply constraints on food. Supplies of many food products including wheat and corn have been affected following Russias invasion of Ukraine. Industry groups have warned the EU faces a shortage of sunflower oil. In total 46.9% of global exports come from Ukraine and 29.9% from Russia according to S&P Global but with Ukraines ports closed it is struggling to export it. I\m truly worried about looming hunger particularly in poor countries that can least afford it Dr Okonjo-Iweala warned. Using Africa as an example the former Nigerian finance minister said 35 of 55 countries there imported wheat and other grains from Russia and Ukraine and 22 imported fertiliser. Work being done by the African Development Bank now shows that in many countries food prices are rising by 20% to 50% already she said. However Dr Okonjo-Iweala said she was hopeful there were solutions to the supply problems. She said in the short term countries could be changing our dietary tastes to eat more homegrown products. She added in the longer term Africa was investing in heat tolerant varieties of wheat and other crops as it adapts to climate change. Media caption Watch: Ros Atkins on why the war in Ukraine is pushing up food prices - and the likely impact on poorer countries As well as food prices surging the cost of other commodities have hit record highs amid concerns the war and economic sanctions on Russia will lead to supply disruptions. Russias mining industry is hugely important for many substances such as palladium where it is responsible for 40% of global production of the metal that is essential for carmakers. Even before the war in Ukraine the pandemic had caused a mismatch between supply and demand in many industries which pushed prices up and the International Monetary Fund has warned that soaring inflation will reduce global economic growth this year. In the short to medium term I think that we are going to see these inflationary pressures continue Dr Okonjo-Iweala said. Trade battle with Russia Trade has become a key tool many countries have used to pressure President Vladimir Putin over his decision to invade Ukraine. Ukraine has cut economic ties with Russia and led calls for it to be suspended from the WTO because of the war. However no country has ever been expelled from the WTO something the Director-General said is not an easy thing to do. She says there is no mechanism to kick Russia out despite some leading international trade lawyers disagreeing.

About 32200 applications have been made to the UK government scheme which is open to refugees with a named sponsor. However with more than four million Ukrainians displaced by war the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the figure was woefully small. The UK government said applications were processed as quickly as possible. Since the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme launched on 14 March a total of 4700 visas - less than 15% of applications - have been issued in the UK. Another 24000 visas - about 75% of the 32800 applications - have been issued to Ukrainians with family in the UK under a separate scheme. Refugee host: These people did not ask for war How can I offer a UK home to Ukrainian refugees? Super sponsor scheme opens for Ukrainian refugees The aim of Homes for Ukraine was to allow individuals charities community groups and other organisations to sponsor refugees housing them in their homes or buildings. The Scottish government said it wanted to be a super sponsor of Ukrainian refugees and vowed to provide people fleeing the war with temporary accommodation until a longer-term place can be found. A total 210 visas have been issued through the scheme so far - 180 visas to those who had an individual sponsor in Scotland and 30 who had applied to be sponsored through the Scottish governments super sponsor initiative. Woefully small number of visas granted Speaking after the new figures were published on Friday Nicola Sturgeon said the figure isn\t good enough. The process of translating applications into visas is unacceptably slow she added. The UK government is letting the people of Ukraine down and also letting down people across Scotland who have opened their homes. The UK requires the refugees to have a visa before they enter unlike other European countries which have waived the checks to speed things up. Ms Sturgeon added: It is neither reasonable nor morally acceptable to expect people fleeing a brutal invasion to go through the bureaucratic processes being put in their way and wait weeks to be given a visa. We have called for the need for visas to be waived by the UK government] so displaced people could immediately reach a place of safety just as our European neighbours have done. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES A spokesman for the UK government said: We are moving as quickly as possible to ensure that those fleeing Ukraine can find safety in the UK through the Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine. We have streamlined the process so valid passport holders do not have to attend in-person appointments before arriving in the UK simplified our forms and boosted caseworker numbers while ensuring vital security checks are carried out. We continue to speed up visa processing across both schemes with over 29000 visas issued in the last three weeks alone and thousands more expected to come through these uncapped routes. The UN refugee agency said more than four million refugees have now fled Ukraine since Russia launched its war in the biggest refugee crisis since World War Two.

A video shared on Twitter showed a blaze near apartment blocks in Belgorod 40km (25 miles) from the border. Some clips appeared to show rockets hitting the oil depot. Ukraines top security official however denied Ukrainian forces were behind the attack. For some reason they are saying we are behind it. This does not correspond to reality security council secretary Oleksiy Danilov said. Ukrainian aircraft have not struck targets in Russia previously. Yet Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov accused Ukraine of launching the attack and later Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov gave details. He said that at around 05:00 Moscow time (02:00 GMT) two Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopters entered Russian airspace at extremely low altitude and launched a missile attack on a civilian oil storage facility on the outskirts of Belgorod. Some storage tanks were damaged and caught fire he said. The oil storage facility has nothing to do with the Russian armed forces he said. President Vladimir Putin\s spokesman said the incident cannot be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for continuing the talks with Kyiv. So far those peace talks have made little progress. The spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was now trying to reorganise the fuel supply chain to prevent disruption of Belgorods energy supplies. The city of 370000 lies just north of Ukraines second city Kharkiv which has been heavily shelled by Russian artillery and remains surrounded by Russian forces. Governor Gladkov said in a Telegram message that nobody was killed at the oil depot which is run by Russian state oil firm Rosneft. He said emergency workers were trying to contain the fire and there was no threat to residents. The emergencies ministry posted video of the blaze on Telegram. Russias Interfax news agency reported that residents nearby were evacuated and two people were injured at the depot. It said eight fuel tanks were on fire and nearly 200 firefighters were on the scene. Queues of cars later formed at local petrol stations but Mr Gladkov said Belgorods fuel supplies were still plentiful. Russias RIA Novosti news agency says the blaze in three of the tanks has been extinguished but there is still a risk of the fire spreading. On 29 March several explosions were reported at an ammunition depot near Belgorod. Commenting on the oil depot blaze Ukrainian defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said Russian aggression was being resisted on the territory of Ukraine. It does not mean that Ukraine has to bear responsibility for all those catastrophes and all those events that happen on the territory of the Russian Federation. This is not the first time we have seen such accusations. So dear friends I will neither confirm nor deny this information he said. Ukraine is yet to claim responsibility for this attack but if it were confirmed it would be the first time that Ukrainian aircraft have flown into Russian airspace to hit a target. bringing the war home to Russia. Ukrainian helicopter pilots have plenty of experience of flying low and fast to avoid being detected by military radar and air defence systems. Theyve been doing exactly that in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine for years. I experienced and witnessed the extraordinary skills of the Ukrainian military pilots in 2018 - flying barely metres above the tree line and telegraph poles. But if these unconfirmed reports are correct - flying at night well into Russian territory to launch an attack on an enemy fuel depot would have required extraordinary bravery - as well as finely-honed flying skills. Low-flying helicopters are still vulnerable to short-range air defence systems. Flying at night would have lessened that risk but heightened the danger of hitting an object near the ground. The Mi-24 or Hind helicopter is known as the flying tank. Its rockets would have been the weapon deployed to target the oil depot in Belgorod Russia. This alleged attack alone will not dramatically alter the battle. But it could show Ukraine has managed to keep its air force functioning and give a huge boost to the morale of Ukraines military. A well-known Ukrainian journalist in Kyiv Yury Butusov posted on Facebook that it was a missile attack at 05:50 local time (02:50 GMT) by two Ukrainian Mi-24 combat helicopters which flew from Ukraine to Russian Belgorod over low altitudes inconspicuous for Russian anti-aircraft defence. Vladimir Soloviev host of a staunchly pro-Kremlin current affairs programme on Russian state TV asked in a tweet: Question. Who is in charge of the Belgorod air defences?

Sir Jeremy Fleming said Chinas long-term interests are not served by an alliance with Moscow. In a rare public address during a visit to Australia Sir Jeremy also said Russia had massively misjudged the situation in Ukraine. He said Vladimir Putin\s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth. Putin advisers too scared to tell him truth - US US warns China against helping Russia in Ukraine Ukraine War: Putin demands Mariupol surrender to end shelling Why has Putin invaded? Sir Jeremy said China\s aspirations to become a leading player on the global stage were not well served by close alliance with a regime that wilfully and illegally ignores international rules. The speech at the Australian National University in Canberra comes after Downing Street said Boris Johnson had a frank and candid discussion with China\s President Xi Jinping last week. Sir Jeremy said that Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a clear strategic choice to align with China as it grows more powerful in opposition to the United States. He said the Kremlin regards China in the current crisis as a supplier of weapons technology and a potential market for its oil and gas. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption GCHQ Director Jeremy Fleming was speaking in Australia But Sir Jeremy suggested President Xi has a more nuanced view of the relationship. Russia understands that long term China will become increasingly strong militarily and economically. Some of their interests conflict; Russia could be squeezed out of the equation. Meanwhile echoing comments from US and Ukrainian officials the GCHQ boss said Mr Putin underestimated the strength of the coalition his actions would galvanise. He under-played the economic consequences of the sanctions regime. He over-estimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory. However Sir Jeremy said the extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime.

And despite high hopes peace talks in Istanbul have reportedly failed to provide even a respite in the fighting let alone a breakthrough. Both sides are in Turkey for the talks with high expectations set on Tuesday. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has since said that while the Ukraine side had set out proposals on paper there was nothing promising in terms of signs of a breakthrough. Ukraine said it could become a neutral state - with security guarantees - to assuage Russias fears it might join the Western military alliance Nato. But Russia dismissed Ukraines proposal for talks about Crimea which Russia annexed by military means in 2014. And as the talks went on officials in Ukraine said there had been no let-up in attacks on the northern city of Chernihiv despite a Russian pledge to reduce military activity there. The governor of the Chernihiv region Viacheslav Chaus told the BBC that the city had experienced a tense night while residents said shelling had continued into Wednesday.

That means at least a quarter of the population have had to abandon their homes because of the war. Its the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two - Poland alone has received 2.3 million Ukrainian refugees. The BBCs Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says there can be no quick fix to such a major humanitarian crisis. Europes unity and generosity will be needed not for weeks but possibly years she adds. Putin demands Mariupol surrender to end shelling Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that shelling of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol will only end when Ukrainian troops surrender. Mr Putin made the comments during an hour-long phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday night the Kremlin said in a statement. But French officials said the Russian leader had agreed to consider plans to evacuate civilians from the city. It comes as new satellite photos showed the destruction caused by the shelling. The images released by the Earth observation company Maxar showed that residential areas have been reduced to rubble and highlighted Russian artillery cannons in firing positions on the outskirts of the city. IMAGE SOURCE MAXAR How are Russians getting news about the war in Ukraine? IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Marina Ovsyannikova an editor at state-controlled Channel 1 was detained after she ran onto a news set holding a sign saying no war The situation in Russias media is unprecedented. Restrictions on reporting are increasingly severe and access to almost all independent outlets is blocked or limited - or they censor themselves. For most Russians television remains the main source of the news. It is firmly controlled by the Kremlin and pumps out relentless pro-war propaganda. Ukrainians are said to shell their own cities and Russian troops are presented as liberators. There is more variety of opinion in the print press but it still largely sticks to the Kremlin line. The independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta suspended operations on 28 March after receiving warnings from Russias media watchdog Roskomnadzor. But while many independent online outlets are blocked restrictions are relatively easy to get around for internet-savvy Russians familiar with tools like virtual private networks (VPNs).

The match had been due to be played at Hampden last week with the winner then playing Wales for a place in the tournament in Qatar later this year. It was rescheduled for June after Russia invaded but there have been fears Ukraine would not be able play. Journalist Andrew Todos said he believed the game would go ahead. Many of Ukraines top international players play in their domestic league and all men aged between 18-60 had been banned from leaving the country under its martial law rules. However Mr Todos told BBC Radio Scotlands Lunchtime Live programme that players from Dynamo Kiev - one of Ukraines biggest clubs - had now been given special permission by the ministry of sport to play friendly matches outside of the country. Not yet qualified but Scots await World Cup draw Scotland v Ukraine postponed The Ukrainian football expert said: Over the next few weeks or couple of months they\ll be playing - apparently - against sides such as Legia Warsaw Steaua Bucharest Paris Saint-Germain and some other sides have agreed in principle to play them and raise money for the Ukraine humanitarian aid. The fact that the team has been allowed to leave - I think there\s growing optimism that the Ukraine national team will be allowed to convene outside of Ukraine in the next month or so. The Scottish Football Supporters Association (SFSA) launched a petition last month calling for Ukraine to be allowed to qualify automatically for the World Cup without having to play any more matches. Its chairman Andy Smith said FIFA - which has already kicked Russia out of the tournament - had an opportunity to do the right thing even if it meant making it harder for Scotland to qualify. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Ukraine coach Oleksandr Petrakov is trying to set up a training camp for his team ahead of the match with Scotland Mr Todos said the Ukrainian squad was keen to qualify for the tournament by winning on the pitch. He said: The Ukraine captain has already said as long as we\ve got arms and legs we want to finish this on the pitch - we\ll let our soldiers do what they\re doing on the battlefield and we can do this for them. I think the logistics are in place for them to get the kit out to get the training staff out. All that remains is to work out where Ukraine will be based the few weeks before the match starts. Scotland coach Steve Clarke said last week that it was difficult to see the game being played in June because of the war. He said: It\s not just the fixture it\s the fact they need to get together have a training camp and get all their players on the pitch with a proper period of time to prepare for such an important game. His Ukrainian counterpart Oleksandr Petrakov has told the Guardian that he was trying to arrange a training camp for his players outside of the country possibly in the UK ahead of the match. He said his team - many of whom have been unable to play or train since the invasion - would need to play five or six practice matches to return to full fitness without which it would be very hard to get to play with Scotland. Both Scotland and Ukraine will be included in Fridays World Cup draw despite neither having yet qualified for the tournament which will be played in November.

Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin approved parallel imports as part of a fourth package of support for small and medium-sized businesses. The Wests response to Russias war has prompted a surge in inflation. The prime minister said until now goods could not be sold in Russia without the trademark owners authorisation. The aim of letting retailers import products without the companies\ permission he explained was to saturate the market so that people had fast access to necessary goods guaranteeing supply despite the unfriendly actions of foreign politicians. Lists of products were to be co-ordinated with the ministry of industry and trade Mr Mishustin said in a televised address. Russian reports indicate they will focus on consumer products where prices have risen. Annual inflation has soared this week to 15.66%. Sugar in particular has been hit by price rises and shortages and Russias anti-monopoly service said it was investigating the countrys five biggest producers. In a bid to prop up the currency Russia announced last week that unfriendly countries would have to pay for their natural gas in roubles from Thursday. The EU has rejected the idea and Germany said Chancellor Olaf Scholz had been told that Europe would be able to continue paying in euros to a Russian bank not under sanctions which would then convert the money into roubles. Hundreds of global brands such as Apple and H&M have also either pulled out of the Russian market or halted sales since the invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February. Several companies have continued to provide basic nutrition and hygiene items. Sports shop Decathlon said this week it was only closing its shops because of supply chain problems while Nestle has suspended the sale of the vast majority of volume and sales in Russia. In a separate development Russian state institutions have been barred from buying foreign software from Thursday for so-called critical information infrastructure without prior government consent.

By Paul Kirby BBC News Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Media caption Drone footage shows the extent of destruction in cities across Ukraine since the start of the war When Vladimir Putin shattered the peace in Europe by unleashing war on a democracy of 44 million people his justification was that modern Western-leaning Ukraine was a constant threat and Russia could not feel safe develop and exist. But after five weeks of bombardment thousands of deaths in ruined cities and the displacement of more than 10 million people inside Ukraine and beyond the questions remain: what is his aim and is there a way out? What was Putins goal? The Russian leaders initial aim was to overrun Ukraine and depose its government ending for good its desire to join the Western defensive alliance Nato. But the invasion has become bogged down and he appears to have scaled back his ambitions. Launching the invasion on 24 February he told the Russian people his goal was to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine to protect people subjected to what he called eight years of bullying and genocide by Ukraine\s government. It is not our plan to occupy the Ukrainian territory. We do not intend to impose anything on anyone by force he insisted. This was not even a war or invasion he claimed merely the fiction of a special military operation that Russian state-controlled media are required to adopt. The claims of Nazis and genocide in Ukraine were completely unfounded but it was clear Russia saw this as a pivotal moment. Russia\s future and its future place in the world are at stake said foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin. Russias military aimed to sweep into the capital Kyiv invading from Belarus in the north as well as from the south and east. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke of freeing Ukraine from oppression while Ukraine\s democratically elected President Volodymyr Zelensky said the enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two. But Ukraines fierce resistance has caused heavy losses and in some areas driven Russian forces back. Has Putin changed his aims? Russia does appear to have lowered its ambitions claiming it has generally accomplished the aims of the invasion\s first phase which it defined as considerably reducing Ukraine\s combat potential. Russia announced at peace talks that it would be drastically reducing its military operations around the capital and around the northern city of Chernihiv. That is yet to be confirmed and Ukraines President Zelensky has said Ukraine can only trust concrete results not words. The war continues particularly in the east and the south where Russian forces are trying to create a land corridor along the south coast east from Crimea to the Russian border. A month into the invasion Russia declared its main goal was the liberation of Donbas - broadly referring to Ukraine\s eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. More than a third of this area was already seized by Russian-backed separatists in a war that began in 2014. Ahead of the invasion it was clear President Putin wanted all of the east recognising the whole area as belonging to two Russian puppet statelets. The head of the Luhansk statelet has suggested holding a referendum on joining Russia similar to an internationally discredited vote held in Crimea in 2014. Beyond his military goals President Putins broader demand is to ensure Ukraines future neutrality. The Ukrainians have offered that in return for security guarantees from allies as part of a wide-ranging peace plan presented in talks in Turkey. Why Putin wants a neutral Ukraine Since Ukraine achieved independence in 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed it has gradually veered towards the West - both the EU and Nato. Russia\s leader has sought to reverse that seeing the fall of the Soviet Union as the disintegration of historical Russia. He has claimed Russians and Ukrainians are one people and denied Ukraine its long history: Ukraine never had stable traditions of genuine statehood he asserted. It was his pressure on Ukraines pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych not to sign a deal with the European Union in 2013 that led to protests that ultimately ousted the Ukrainian president in February 2014. Russia then seized Ukraines southern region of Crimea and triggered a separatist rebellion in the east and a war that claimed 14000 lives. As he prepared to invade in February he tore up an unfulfilled 2015 Minsk peace deal and accused Nato of threatening our historic future as a nation claiming without foundation that Nato countries wanted to bring war to Crimea. What would neutrality look like? Before Ukraine presented its plans Russia said it was considering a neutral demilitarised Ukraine with its own army and navy along the lines of Austria or Sweden which are both EU members. Austria is neutral while Sweden is non-aligned. President Zelensky had already declared that Ukrainians now understood they would will not be admitted to Nato: It\s a truth and it must be recognised. EPA/Ukraine presidency Security guarantees and neutrality the non-nuclear status of our state - we are ready to go for it... If I remember correctly this is why Russia] started the war Volodymyr Zelensky President of Ukraine Russia does not see Ukraines peace proposals as either promising or a breakthrough so the war will continue. But this is Kyivs offer: Ukraine would become a non-bloc (or non-aligned) and non-nuclear state with no foreign military bases or contingents on its territory Strict legally binding guarantees would require countries such as the UK China the USA Turkey France Canada Italy Poland and Israel to protect a neutral Ukraine in the event of attack Within three days guarantor states would have to hold consultations and come to Ukraines defence Ukraine would be allowed to join the European Union Ukraine would not enter military-political alliances and any international exercises would require consent of guarantor states. Ukraines bid to join Nato (and the EU) is enshrined in its 2019 constitution so any change would require a referendum some months later. What about Crimea and the east? Russia is so far unimpressed with Ukraines plan for the future status of Crimea seized by Russia in 2014 to be decided during 15 years of consultations. The Kremlin says Crimea is now Russian territory and the Russian constitution bars discussing its status with anyone else. As part of Kyivs peace proposals all Russian troops would leave Ukrainian territory and the future of the eastern areas held by Russian-backed separatists would be discussed by the two presidents as part of a ceasefire summit. However President Putin will not wish to abandon any territorial gains made during the war especially as the declared aim is liberating Ukraine\s east. Kyiv meanwhile will never agree to ceding its sovereign territory. Ukraine has never taken seriously Russia\s demand for militarisation and Moscow\s insistence on de-Nazification is merely Russian propaganda. In the words of Ukraine\s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba: It\s crazy sometimes not even they can explain what they are referring to. President Zelensky has said he is prepared to give Russian minority language status along with the languages of other neighbouring countries and does not see this as a major issue. Whats Putins problem with Nato? For Russias leader the Wests 30-member defensive military alliance has one aim - to split society in Russia and ultimately destroy it. Ahead of the war he demanded that Nato turn the clock back to 1997 and reverse its eastward expansion removing its forces and military infrastructure from member states that joined the alliance from 1997 and not deploying strike weapons near Russia\s borders. That means Central Europe Eastern Europe and the Baltics. In President Putin\s eyes the West promised back in 1990 that Nato would expand not an inch to the east but did so anyway. That was before the collapse of the Soviet Union however so the promise made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev only referred to East Germany in the context of a reunified Germany. Mr Gorbachev said later that the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed at the time. Does Putin have designs beyond Ukraine? If he has his military setbacks in Ukraine may have put paid to any wider ambitions beyond Ukraine. After hours of conversations with Russia\s authoritarian leader German Chancellor Olaf Scholz concluded: Putin wants to build a Russian empire... He wants to fundamentally redefine the status quo within Europe in line with his own vision. And he has no qualms about using military force to do so. Tatiana Stanovaya of analysis firm RPolitik and the Carnegie Moscow Center fears a spiral in a new Cold War confrontation: I have very firm feelings that we should get prepared for a new ultimatum to the West which will be more militarised and aggressive than we could have imagined. Having witnessed Mr Putins willingness to lay waste European cities to achieve his aims Western leaders are now under no illusion. President Joe Biden has labelled him a war criminal and the leaders of both Germany and France see this war as a turning point in the history of Europe. Before the war Russia demanded all US nuclear arms be barred from beyond their national territories. The US had offered to start talks on limiting short- and medium-range missiles as well as on a new treaty on intercontinental missiles but there is little chance of that happening for now.

He knew Natos members would never put boots on the ground in Ukraine but he could not have guessed the extent of the sanctions that are already having a dramatic effect on Russias economy - and he is furious. The EU US UK and other Western nations have targeted Russias economy in a variety of ways: Russias central bank has had its assets frozen and major banks are shut out of the international SWIFT payment transfer network. The US has banned imports of Russian oil and gas; the EU aims to cut gas imports by two-thirds within a year; and the UK aims to phase out Russian oil by the end of 2022 Germany has halted approval on Russias Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline a major investment by both Russia and European companies Russian airlines have been barred from airspace over the EU UK US and Canada Personal sanctions have been imposed on President Putin Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and many other individuals No peace deal with Ukraine will bring these sanctions to an end and Vladimir Putin knows that. Instead he has turned on Russians who have opposed the war. The Russian people will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors said Russia\s president. More than 15100 anti-war protesters have been detained and virtually all independent media have been silenced. There is no meaningful political opposition left as they have either fled the country or in the case of opposition leader Alexei Navalny jailed for years in a strict-regime penal colony.]War in Ukraine: President Zelensky addresses Australian parliament,Ukraine's president received a standing ovation after speaking to the Australian parliament.,]"Ukraine: 'I am safe, my daughter is safe, that's the main thing'",Diana Sachavo and her mother Olena are among the first to arrive under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.,Ukraine: I am safe my daughter is safe thats the main thing By Lucy Manning and Phil Kemp BBC News Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption Clare met Diana and Olena at the airport That\s her isn\t it?

They have called for the UK to stop requiring visas for those fleeing Ukraine. Downing Street meanwhile has said the Home Office has made the process quicker and easier - including making the visa form shorter and allowing valid passport holders to apply online and complete biometric checks in the UK. But refugees minister Lord Harrington acknowledged more needed to be done. We are starting to see progress because of changes the Home Office made to streamline the visa process and put additional resources into the system. However we need to do more and will be making further improvements to bring people to the UK as quickly as possible.

Alla Stoica from Carlisle Cumbria submitted applications for her sister-in-law and nephew in Kyiv nearly two weeks ago but has heard nothing since. It\s not straightforward at all the 40-year-old former nurse said of the government\s Ukraine Family Scheme. The Home Office said it was moving as quickly as possible. Ms Stoica who is originally from Kyiv but moved to Carlisle 16 years ago said: I\ve got a little bit of experience because the process is similar to applying for a tourist visa and I\ve applied for those for my parents in the past. But still to do two applications for my sister-in-law and my nephew it took most of the day. The Ukraine Family Scheme is for those with close relatives living in the UK and has issued 22800 visas out of 31200 applications the Home Office said. Only 2700 visas have been issued out of 28300 applications made under the Homes for Ukraine scheme in which strangers can offer sanctuary to refugees. A Home Office spokesperson said: We have streamlined the process so valid passport holders do not have to attend in-person appointments before arriving in the UK simplified our forms and boosted caseworker numbers while ensuring vital security checks are carried out.

Ms Stoica who is married to a local restaurant owner said she did not believe Russia\s pledge to reduce military action around the capital in order to boost mutual trust in peace talks. I don\t think anyone believes it] she said. She said any scaling down was due to Russian forces being pushed back by Ukrainian troops not because of negotiation. They know they\ve got no chance to take Kyiv she said. I spoke to my brother this morning and there was still heavy shelling and there were still explosions last night and the night before.

Here are the latest developments on day 37 of the invasion: Ukrainian forces retaking key positions around Kyiv Shelling remains ongoing in Kyiv and in Chernihiv Russian troops said to be withdrawing from Chernobyl Port city of Mariupol remains likely to fall to Russia soon Ukrainian forces repelling Russian attacks in the Donbas Russia redeploying troops to Ukraine from Georgia Russia launched its attack on 24 February but five weeks into the war it is having to bolster its forces by redeploying troops from Georgia after suffering unexpected losses according to the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD). Ukrainian counter-attacks have pushed Russian troops back in a number of places and the MoD says that Russia is struggling to sustain its operations across multiple areas of engagement. Ukrainians fight back around Kyiv Russian forces have lost ground around Kyiv in recent days and they have moved from trying to encircle the capital to withdrawing to positions that are more easily defended according to Jack Watling a defence analyst at the Royal United Services Institute. Ukrainian forces have successfully pushed Russian troops back in a number of areas on the outskirts of Kyiv including in the suburb of Irpin about 20km (12 miles) to the west. These counter-attacks are pushing Russian artillery further out of range of central Kyiv but shelling of the suburbs has continued as Russian forces try to defend their positions. To the east of the capital Ukrainian forces have reclaimed ground from the Russians around the suburb of Brovary about 20km (12 miles) away from the centre of Kyiv. The Russian advance on Kyiv from the east has been hindered by the failure to take control of Chernihiv a major city to the north-east that sits between the capital and the Russian border. The aerial bombardment of Chernihiv has continued in recent days but analysts at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) say some Russian units are being withdrawn from around the city - and from around Kyiv Chernobyl and Sumy - to be redeployed in the east of the country.

FUEL: Could the world cope without Russian oil? READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Russian progress slows in the south Russian forces initially made rapid gains in the south with their main objective being the creation of a land corridor between Crimea which it annexed in 2014 and areas held by Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk. Standing in the way of that objective has been the port city of Mariupol which has been encircled by Russian forces since the start of March. Russian forces have been advancing further into the centre of Mariupol recently and the city is likely to fall within days according to the ISW. More than 100000 civilians are thought to be trapped in the besieged city and its deputy mayor says people there are dying from starvation and dehydration. To the west Russia had been attempting to push towards Odesa with the aim of cutting off Ukraines access to the Black Sea. But their advances stalled at Mykolaiv where a counter-attack by Ukrainian troops has pushed Russian forces back towards the city of Kherson. Russian troops in the area are now concentrating on maintaining their current positions rather than taking new ground according to the ISW. Russia targets full control in the east With recent setbacks elsewhere in the country Russian officials have said that the focus of its forces is now the complete liberation of the Donbas. The Donbas broadly refers to Ukraines eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before Russias invasion. Analysts says Russian forces in the region are trying to encircle Ukrainian troops there by advancing from Kharkiv to the north and Mariupol from the south. But Ukrainian forces have repelled several recent assaults particularly around the town of Rubizhne and Russian forces have failed to make any significant gains recently according to the ISW.

About these maps To indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the Institute for the Study of War with the American Enterprise Institutes Critical Threats Project. From 2 March this daily assessment differentiated between Assessed Russian-controlled Ukrainian territory and Assessed Russian advances in Ukraine the latter indicating areas where Russians are believed to have launched attacks from but which they do not control. To show key areas where advances are taking place we are also using daily updates from the UK Ministry of Defence and BBC research. The situation in Ukraine is fast moving and it is likely there will be times when there have been changes not reflected in the maps.

According to Ukraine\s state nuclear company Energoatom staff at the plant said there are currently no outsiders at the site. Earlier it said some Russian forces had set off towards the Belarusian border leaving a small group behind. The announcement appears to confirm reports by senior US defence officials on Wednesday of a withdrawal. Russian troops seized Chernobyl at the beginning of their invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. This morning the invaders announced their intentions to leave the Chernobyl nuclear power plant Energoatom said in a statement on Thursday. The company later accused the Russian military of abducting members of the Ukrainian National Guard held captive since the start of the war. Energoatom sourced its information to workers at the plant and did not give numbers. It also confirmed reports that Russian troops had dug trenches in the most contaminated part of the Chernobyl exclusion zone receiving significant doses of radiation. There are unconfirmed reports that some are being treated in Belarus. Reuters news agency quoted workers at the plant as saying some of the soldiers had no idea they were in a radiation zone. The Russian military however said that after capturing the plant radiation levels at the plant itself had stayed within a normal range. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a statement that it was unable to confirm the reports. The head of Ukraines agency in charge of the exclusion zone Yevhen Kramarenko said that radiation levels appeared to be normal and there was no indication of significant damage. However as the sensors for detecting radiation levels were not working staff needed to check the facilities he added. The head of the IAEA said it was in close consultations with Ukrainian authorities on sending a mission to the Chernobyl plant very very soon. While Chernobyl is a word that evokes apocalypse nuclear experts stressed throughout this saga that there was no risk of another Chernobyl. There is no working nuclear reactor on the site. As Prof Claire Corkhill from Sheffield University told me at the time even if buildings containing contaminated material were pierced we wouldn\t be talking about plumes of radioactive smoke. She was much more concerned when Russian forces attacked a building at the working Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility on 4 March. That incident caused the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to plan a trip to Ukraine - essentially to ask Russian forces to keep nuclear facilities out of the line of fire. What is a concern in Chernobyl now Prof Corkhill told me is that we haven\t had regular communication between the site and the IAEA which basically keeps a safety log] of where any potentially hazardous material is. We now need to go in and establish that none of that material is missing. Other scientists are concerned about the damage that may have been caused to a place that has become a wildlife refuge and a site of international research collaboration. Prof Nick Beresford who studies the exclusion zone\s landscape says his Ukrainian colleagues now don\t know if they will have labs to return to. The zone itself over the last nearly 40 years has become a site for wildlife he added. Lots of rare species moved in when people moved out. We just don\t know how this will have affected the wildlife. In recent days Russia has said it will scale down its operations in northern Ukraine around the capital Kyiv and focus its forces on the eastern Donbas region. Chernobyl is located north of Kyiv. But on Thursday Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Moscow was repositioning rather than withdrawing in order to regroup resupply and reinforce its offensive in Donbas. At the same time Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities. So we can expect additional offensive actions bringing even more suffering he said. There was no change in Russias objective to pursue a military outcome he added. The occupation of the Chernobyl site since 24 February the day of the invasion has been dogged with concerns about power outages and problems for the staff many of whom were trapped there for weeks and could not get home. Although no longer a working power station Chernobyl was never fully abandoned and still requires constant management. How close was nuclear plant attack to catastrophe? Chernobyl workers ordeal under Russian guard It is the site of what is considered to be the worlds worst nuclear accident in 1986. The Russian withdrawal follows an announcement several days ago by the mayor of Slavutych a nearby town housing workers at the plant that Russian troops had left the town.

Russia is trying to regroup resupply and reinforce Jens Stoltenberg said. The UK said Russia was bringing in between 1200 and 2000 of its Russian troops from Georgia as reinforcements. Moscow said on Tuesday that it would reduce military activity in northern Ukraine and focus on liberating the Donbas region in the south-east. Mr Stoltenberg said Russias aim of pursuing a military outcome had not changed. We see continued shelling of cities and we see that Russia is re-positioning some of the troops moving some of them around most likely to reinforce their efforts in the Donbas region he said. At the same time Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities. So we can expect additional offensive actions bringing even more suffering. Russian shelling continuing as ground troops regroup Putin advisers too scared to tell him truth - US Ukraine sends buses to Mariupol for rescue efforts Echoing Mr Stoltenberg\s remarks the UK\s Defence Secretary Ben Wallace warned that Russia\s change in tactics was not a retreat. The UK also said bringing in Russian troops from breakaway areas of Georgia had not been part of Moscows original plan. It is highly unlikely that Russia planned to generate reinforcements in this manner and it is indicative of the unexpected losses it has sustained during the invasion the defence ministry tweeted. Around 20% of Russian troops around Kyiv have started to reposition according to a US senior defence official. The official added that the Russians had largely abandoned Hostomel airport outside of Kyiv and are also moving away from the Chernobyl nuclear plant. But they said Russia was keeping the pressure on in the air with air strikes continuing to fall on the cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv in the north. Bombs are also falling on towns and cities in the south which is becoming the key battlefront according to Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko cited by Reuters news agency. On Thursday evening Ukraines air force appealed for more support from Western countries saying it was operating outdated equipment that was no match for Russias more advanced systems had sustained losses and urgently needed modern fighter jets and air defence systems. The air force urged provision of F-15 or F-16 fighter jets which it said had the same advanced technology as the latest Russian fighter jets. Previous discussions had centred around Poland providing Russian-made Mig-29s but the plan was eventually dropped. It also called for the US Patriot or Norwegian Nasams missile systems. Truth: Air superiority is the deciding factor in this war. Air superiority has played a key role in all wars since WWII Ukraine\s air force tweeted. Russia concentrating efforts in Donbas Though US intelligence reports say Russian troops have not made much progress in the east since the invasion began Russia has said it will now concentrate its efforts on liberating the region. The region is home to the self-declared and Russian-backed peoples republics of Luhansk and Donetsk which are part of Ukraine but which Russia recognised as independent three days before invading. But Ukrainian troops have stymied and frustrated Russia\s progress in the region said the US defence intelligence official. They added it remains to be seen whether the refitting and repositioning of troops will make a difference. But that this could mean the conflict is lengthy and more drawn out.

Now the Russians have been pushed out of the area and the BBCs Jeremy Bowen has been to see the grim aftermath of their short-lived occupation. This report contains material some viewers will find disturbing We counted 13 bodies on a nightmarish stretch of road not much more than 200 yards long between Mria and Myla villages whose Ukrainian names translate as Dream and Sweetheart. Two of the dead are confirmed as Ukrainian civilians who were killed by the Russians. The others have not been identified yet - they lie where they were killed - but only two are wearing recognisable Ukrainian military uniforms. Our BBC team was able to get to the area on the main E-40 highway as it approaches Kyiv because Ukrainian forces had captured the sector only 10 hours earlier. The marks of battle and of heavy shelling were everywhere. Petrol stations and a hotel that was well-known for its spa and restaurant were in ruins. Shell holes and craters pockmarked both carriageways. Ukrainian troops changing a wheel in the ruins of a roadside garage said the Russians were about 4km (2.5 miles) away and had pulled their remaining men and armour back after a hard fight lasting several days in the early hours of the morning. Warning: Graphic video ahead Left behind in the heart of the desolation were the dead bodies and a mass of questions and concerns about who they were and how they died. Media caption Watch: Jeremy Bowen finds bodies on a road Russians occupied outside Kyiv Some answers already exist for a couple who were killed by the Russians and left to decompose on 7 March. Their rusty shrapnel riddled car lies in the road next to one of the petrol stations reduced to a shell by fire. Next to it are the burnt and twisted remains of a body that is just about recognisable as the remains of a man. A wedding ring is still on the corpses finger. Stretched out inside the hulk of their car is what is left of the incinerated body of a woman the mouth opened in what looks like a scream. Their deaths were filmed by a Ukrainian drone on 7 March operated by the Bugatti unit of Territorial Defence. The unit released the video which was republished by news organisations around the world. It caused outrage because it showed the cold-blooded killing of a man who had raised his arms to show he was harmless in the classic gesture of surrender. The bodies the BBC discovered in an investigation this month are of Maksim Iowenko and his wife Ksjena. They were part of a convoy of 10 civilian vehicles who were trying to escape the Russians and get to Kyiv. IMAGE SOURCE SUPPLIED Image caption Ksjena and Maksim Iowenko were civilians and should have been protected As they drove down the road they spotted a Russian tank in position dug into the grass verge. The drone video shows it was clearly marked with the letter V one of the identifiers used by the Russian armed forces. The other cars did quick U-turns and drove away at speed. But Maksims car stopped most likely because it was hit. As soon as the car stopped Maksim leapt out and raised his hands. Within seconds he was shot dead. His wife was killed in the car. Also in the car were their six-year-old son and the elderly mother of one of Maksims friends. Both of them survived and were eventually released by the Russian soldiers. They were found walking back down the road and the woman told her family that Maksim was shouting that a child was in the car when he was killed. Both survivors according to the Bugatti drone unit are now safe but deeply traumatised. Warning: Graphic images ahead The car is now burnt out but it was not on fire after the attack. One hypothesis must be that the bodies and the car were set on fire by the Russians to destroy the evidence of what they had done. The Bugatti Unit has submitted its drone video to the Ukrainian authorities and to the Metropolitan Police in London. More burnt cars and dead bodies line the road for the next few hundred yards. No video has emerged to show what happened. A credible working assumption for any investigation must be that the other dead people were killed by the tank crew or other Russian soldiers. IMAGE SOURCE JEREMY BOWEN Image caption Some of the evidence the BBC gathered is too disturbing to show in full. Here a dead man has been covered by rubber tyres IMAGE SOURCE JEREMY BOWEN Image caption Here a Ukrainian soldier gestures towards sets of charred human remains by a burned out vehicle Attempts have been made to destroy the other bodies. Some have been left to rot where they were killed. But other corpses have been piled up and surrounded by tyres. Charred clothing indicates attempts were made to set fires around them. Tyres are flammable and must have been placed there as an accelerant. The emplacement where the tank was dug in has a clear arc of fire across the area where the 13 bodies are lying. The tank has gone but debris was left by its crew including Russian army field rations. In the woods nearby is at least one other tank which has been burnt out after being hit by an anti-tank missile. A Ukrainian soldier produced a wallet he had found in the tank. He emptied out Russian identity papers bank notes in the Russian currency the rouble and small change in Belorussian coppers. The major thrust to the north-west of Kyiv came from invaders who had crossed the border from Belarus Moscows ally. Close by the knocked out tank are the remains of a chaotic camp with dugouts chairs and a long table piled high with the remains of food and drink. They are all surrounded by big piles of garbage rotten food and empty bottles of alcohol. Ukrainian soldiers said shops at the petrol stations were looted. Image caption An abandoned Russian camp: the soldiers are said to have looted petrol stations Next to the table is a large pair of bolt-cutters. Piles of unburied rubbish scattered in a forward position are usually a sign of undisciplined soldiers. We decided to drive two or three kilometres further down the road after Ukrainian soldiers said more Russian armour had been destroyed. In a small village a Russian tank and two armoured personnel carriers were broken and burnt. Some of the wreckage was still smoking. The force of the weapon that destroyed the tank blew off its turret and main gun which lay upside down and half buried in a crater around 15 yards away. In the pine woods on either side of the road Ukrainian soldiers were digging trenches and fox holes with shovels. Others were patrolling. It was far too early to say whether the Russians were gone for good or whether they would be back. What is clear though is that Russian forces under continued pressure from Ukrainian soldiers have been forced to yield strategic territory around Kyiv. Every time they move back the Ukrainian capital and its people become a little safer. Media caption Video captured by a Ukrainian aerial reconnaissance group appears to show Russian forces shooting at civilians As and when the Russians leave more evidence is likely to emerge of civilians having been killed - backing up the many stories that have emerged of such incidents. The gruesome scenes on the road were more than simply the terrible deaths of human beings who had become victims of President Putins decision to invade. It is also a crime scene with evidence that should be collected and preserved for an investigation whenever this war ends. Under the laws of war civilians are protected and when they are killed in defiance of those laws their deaths amount to war crimes.

Moscow said it would drastically reduce its military operations in two key areas of Ukraine to boost mutual trust in the talks which are being held in Istanbul. But while the decision to scale back operations around the capital Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv was the first sign of tangible progress many questions remain unanswered. Its unclear how extensive any reduction in military activity might be. The US has expressed scepticism too - noting how Russia has already refocused its military campaign on Ukraines east. Ukraine\s President Volodymyr Zelensky was more forthright saying positive signals from the talks did not drown out the explosions or Russian shells. The talks also featured an appearance from Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich - hours after reports emerged suggesting he had suffered suspected poisoning symptoms at peace talks earlier this month.

The grainy video has been circulating on social media after first appearing in the early hours of Sunday. Since then its been widely reposted by pro-Russian accounts on various platforms. Ukrainian armed forces Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi said Russia was filming and distributing staged videos in order to discredit Ukraine\s treatment of Russian prisoners. However Oleksiy Arestovych an adviser to President Zelensky said there would be an immediate investigation and added: I would like to remind all our military civilians and defence forces that abusing prisoners of war is a war crime.

The BBCs Andrew Harding has been in the strategic port city of Odesa where the immediate fear of Russian bombardment has eased. But people there are unsure whether it is just a temporary lull in the fighting. The historic and cosmopolitan resort city is gently trying to reconnect with its famously relaxed holiday spirit as if embracing it were a form of defiance against the Kremlin. The recent reopening of clubs beach restaurants and nail salons across Odesa also reflects growing local confidence in the course of the war against Russia at least here on the Black Sea coast.

Ms Vereshchuk also accused Russian troops of blocking the bus convoy at a checkpoint near Vasylivka three hours drive from Mariupol earlier in the day. The Russian Federation again does not let our buses pass she told Ukrainian news agency Unian. The Russian defence ministry said the United Nations refugee agency and the Red Cross would assist in the evacuation of civilians. The evacuation was initially planned for Thursday but the Red Cross has since told Reuters that for logistical and security reasons the evacuation will now happen on Friday. It said a ceasefire would allow people to travel westwards to Zaporizhzhia via the Russian-controlled port of Berdyansk. A spokesperson for the ICRC said its teams were ready to help get civilians out of Mariupol from Friday but only if all parties agreed on the terms. It\s desperately important that this operation takes place. The lives of tens of thousands of people in Mariupol depend on it the spokesperson added. The BBC has spoken to people who have managed to leave the besieged port city in the last few weeks. All of them described a city in ruins with entire districts completely flattened. Diana Yalovets a 23-year-old student said: As we tried to get out we needed to cross the city centre. It was scary to see destroyed streets and buildings. My school was destroyed. It\s painful to see your once beautiful city this way. Mariupol was a safe city. We loved to walk near the sea. There was a park and it was an amazing place just to sit and talk. I just can\t believe we lost everything we had. Although some residents have escaped all previous attempts to establish a ceasefire in Mariupol have collapsed amid accusations of bad faith from both sides. Russia has also been accused of forcibly relocating thousands of civilians to Russia or Russian-controlled areas. Capturing the city would give Russia control of the Azov Sea coastline between Russia and Crimea. The announcement of a truce follows a telephone call on Tuesday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. During the conversation Mr Putin said that shelling of Mariupol would not end until Ukrainian troops surrendered.

Vladimir Putin has signed a decree stating buyers must open rouble accounts in Russian banks from Friday. Nobody sells us anything for free and we are not going to do charity either - that is existing contracts will be stopped the Russian president said. Mr Putins demand is being seen as an attempt to boost the rouble which has been hit by Western sanctions. His decree means foreign buyers of Russian gas would have to open an account at Russias Gazprombank and transfer euros or US dollars into it. Gazprombank would then convert this into roubles which will then be used to make the payment for gas. Though the order comes into effect for gas exported from Friday onwards the payments for that gas will not be paid by European buyers until mid-May Dr Jack Sharples a research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies told the BBC. That suggests there may not be an immediate threat to supplies. Mr Putin said the switch to roubles was meant to strengthen Russias sovereignty and it would stick to its obligations on all contracts if Western nations obliged. Germany said the change announced by Mr Putin amounted to blackmail. Since Russia invaded Ukraine Western nations have issued economic and trading sanctions on Russia but the European Union has not placed bans on oil or gas unlike the US and Canada as its member nations rely heavily on it. The EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia and has no easy substitutes if supplies are disrupted. Meanwhile Russia currently gets €400m (£340m) per day from gas sales to the bloc and it has no way of rerouting this supply to other markets. For the Kremlin this is designed to suggest a dramatic escalation in the economic battle between the West and Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has outlined a pathway for the cutting of gas supplies to Europe if Western customers refuse to pay for supplies in the Russian currency the rouble. However the market reaction suggests the details of the mechanism mean that in practice European customers will just have to change their currency dealers to Gazprombank. That bank has already been left unsanctioned by the EU for the purpose of continuity of energy trade. As a result gas prices remain very high but did not today shoot into the stratosphere. There should be a workaround. As one leading analyst told me this solution has saved face for Putin who can sound tough on domestic TV. Ultimately as Russian officials have repeatedly said for decades Russian supply of energy to the West continued uninterrupted even during the height of the Cold War. Ultimately Russia still needs the money for the gas and still wants to leave the possibility of a market for its main export once a peace deal is signed. However it is also true to say that the threat of a cut-off has escalated. EU nations have prepared emergency measures to manage demand and would be more willing to face that now during spring and summer than winter. The net effect of the mechanism announced is to limit the ability of the West to freeze the revenues they pay to Gazprom which Putin described as receiving the gas for free. Some Ukrainian officials have suggested such an approach. Oil and gas dollars and euros continue to help the Kremlin resist an otherwise tough set of financial sanctions. Major potential escalation Analysts said Russia halting gas flows to EU member countries to force the issue would mark a major escalation not even performed at the height of the Cold War. It would mark another major financial blow to Russia\s coffers the analysts at Fitch Solutions added. It is also unclear whether Russias new payment mechanism for gas would fully ban payments in euros. Western companies and governments have rejected Russias demands to pay for gas in roubles as a breach of existing contracts which are set in euros or US dollars. Germany and Austria take step towards gas rationing Russia to allow unauthorised imports from West German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said German companies would continue to pay for Russian gas using euros as stipulated in contracts. Nathan Piper head of oil and gas research at Investec told the BBC the move by Mr Putin was an attempt to put economic pressure back on Europe and that more foreign exchange demand for roubles would likely push up the value of the currency. However long term Russia needs to remain a reliable supplier of gas so it is unclear if they would actually restrict gas supply he added. That said even the risk of it is keeping UK/European gas prices at near record highs and six times the 10-year average. This is translating to steep rises in consumers\ energy bills. IMAGE SOURCE AFP Image caption The Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline was inaugurated just over a decade ago between Russia and Germany Dr Sharples of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said the two sides could adapt and continue their trade uninterrupted or one or both parties could claim breach of contract and escalate the situation. One would hope that even if the situation escalated to a point where one or both parties call for arbitration that the gas would continue to flow. However a stoppage cannot be ruled out he said. Germany and Austria trigger emergency plans Germany which gets about half its gas and a third of its oil from Russia has urged its citizens and companies to reduce consumption in anticipation of possible shortages. Austria which imports about 40% of its gas from Russia is tightening its monitoring of the market. Under an existing gas emergency plan the early warning phase which both Germany and Austria have begun is the first of three steps designed to prepare the country for a potential supply shortage. In its final stage the governments would bring in gas rationing. Elsewhere Bulgaria which gets 90% of its gas via imports from Russian company Gazprom has opened a tender for underground drilling as part of plans to almost double the countrys gas storage capacity and prepare for any supply disruptions. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases. The UK government said it was not planning to pay for Russian gas in roubles.]HARDtalk: Maria Butina: What is Russia achieving in Ukraine?,Stephen Sackur speaks to a pro-Putin member of Russia’s state Duma,Unknown"Ukraine war: Putin being misled by fearful advisers, US says","News on Russia's poor military performance is not making it back to Putin, the White House says.",Ukraine war: Putin being misled by fearful advisers US says Published 2 days ago comments Comments Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption The US and UK say Putin is being misinformed by his advisers Russian President Vladimir Putin is being misled by advisers who are too scared to tell him how badly the war in Ukraine is going the White House says. Meanwhile British intelligence says Russian troops in Ukraine are demoralised short of equipment and refusing to carry out orders. Mr Putin is also not being told about the full impact of sanctions on the Russian economy the White House said. The Kremlin said the US had a total misunderstanding of the situation. Mr Putin\s chief spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists: They simply don\t understand what\s happening in the Kremlin they don\t understand President Putin they don\t understand how decisions are taken and they don\t understand the style of our work. This was worrying he added because such total misunderstanding leads to wrong decisions which have bad consequences. Earlier White House spokesperson Kate Bedingfield said the US had information that Mr Putin felt misled by the Russian military and this had resulted in persistent tension between Putin and his military leadership. Putin\s war has been a strategic blunder that has left Russia weaker over the long term and increasingly isolated on the world stage she said. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby called the assessments discomforting because an uninformed Putin could result in a less than faithful effort at ending the conflict through peace negotiations. The other thing is you don\t know how a leader like that is going to react to getting bad news he said. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption People are continuing to be evacuated from Irpin where Ukraine says it has pushed Russia back Ukrainian forces have begun attempts to retake some areas from Russia which on Tuesday said it would scale back operations around Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv. Jeremy Fleming the head of the UK\s cyber-intelligence agency GCHQ said the move added to indications Russia had massively misjudged the situation and had been forced to significantly rethink. We\ve seen Russian soldiers - short of weapons and morale - refusing to carry out orders sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft Mr Fleming said in a speech to the Australian National University in Canberra. And even though Putin\s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth what\s going on and the extent of these misjudgements must be crystal clear to the regime. On the ground US and Ukrainian officials say Russia is continuing to reposition forces away from Kyiv probably as part of its effort to refocus on eastern regions. In other developments: President Volodymyr Zelensky cast doubt on Russia\s claims it was de-escalating calling it the precursor to new strikes in the eastern Donbas region. We don\t believe anyone. Not a single beautiful word he said Russias defence ministry proposed a one-day ceasefire in besieged Mariupol on Thursday to let people leave. This came after Mr Putin said Mariupol would have to surrender to stop the shelling A US defence official said some Russian troops were leaving the Chernobyl area - home to a former nuclear plant that was the site of the world\s worst nuclear accident in 1986 - and heading to neighbouring Belarus. We think that they are leaving I can\t tell you that they\re all gone the official said Four million Ukrainians have fled the country and a quarter of the population has been displaced French military intelligence chief Gen Éric Vidaud has been dismissed from his post for not predicting the Russian invasion French media report Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine are due to restart online on 1 April according to Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia. In an online post cited by Reuters Mr Arakhamia said Ukraine had proposed the leaders of both countries meet but Russia declined saying more work was needed on a draft treaty. Mr Zelensky meanwhile characterised the talks as only words no specifics yet following a similarly downbeat assessment from Russia. Delegations from Moscow and Kyiv held three hours of discussions in Istanbul on Tuesday. Ukraine said it had proposed to become a neutral state in exchange for security guarantees.

By Jake Horton Daniele Palumbo & Tim Bowler BBC Reality Check Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Fuel prices have soared since Russias invasion of Ukraine President Vladimir Putin has threatened to cut gas supplies to unfriendly countries if they don\t start paying for gas imports in Russian roubles. The US EU and UK placed restrictions on oil and gas imports from Russia after it invaded Ukraine in February. What sanctions are there on Russian oil and gas? The US has declared a complete ban on Russian oil gas and coal imports. The UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year and the EU is reducing its Russian gas imports by two-thirds. The UK government says this allows enough time for it to find alternative supplies. Deputy Russian Prime Minister Alexander Novak has said rejecting Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market. Oil and gas prices have risen since the invasion of Ukraine and if Russia were to halt exports they could rise further. What would happen if Russian gas stopped flowing into Europe? Heating prices - which are already high - would increase even more. Russian gas accounts for about 40% of the EUs natural gas imports. If this dried up Italy and Germany would be especially vulnerable. Europe could turn to existing gas exporters such Qatar Algeria or Nigeria but there are practical obstacles to quickly expanding production. Russia only provides about 5% of the UKs gas supplies and the US doesnt import any Russian gas. Gas prices in Europe the UK (and to a lesser extent the US) jumped significantly after the invasion due to worries about supply shortages although they then fell back. Could alternatives to Russian gas be found? The US has agreed to ship an additional 15 billion cubic metres of liquified natural gas (LNG) to Europe by the end of this year. The aim is to supply 50 billion cubic metres per year of additional gas until at least 2030. But energy policy research analyst Ben McWilliams says its not very easy to substitute the gas that flows from Russia. It\s harder to substitute gas because we have these big pipes that are taking Russian gas to Europe says Mr McWilliams. Europe could also ramp up the use of other energy sources but doing so is not quick or easy. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption The EU hopes to massively boost its use of renewable energy including wind power Renewables take time to roll out so in the short term this is not a solution says research analyst Simone Tagliapietra. So for next winter - what can make a difference is fuel switching such as opening up coal-fired power plants as Italy and Germany have plans to do in case of an emergency. The EU has proposed a plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels before 2030 - including measures to diversify gas supplies and replace gas in heating and power generation. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline and the Ukraine crisis IEA: Green energy needed to avoid turbulent prices How much oil does Russia export? Russia is the third biggest producer of oil in the world behind the US and Saudi Arabia. Of about five million barrels of crude oil it exports each day more than half of that goes to Europe. Russian imports account for 8% of total UK oil demand. The US is less reliant with about 3% of its imported oil coming from Russia in 2020. What about alternative oil supplies? Mr McWilliams says it should be easier to find alternative suppliers for oil than for gas because while some comes from Russia there\s also a lot of shipments from elsewhere. US President Joe Biden has ordered a major release of oil from Americas strategic reserves in an effort to bring down high fuel costs. The US has been asking Saudi Arabia to increase its oil production but it has rebuffed previous US requests to boost output in order to reduce oil prices. Saudi Arabia is the biggest producer in Opec the oil cartel which accounts for about 60% of the crude oil traded internationally. Because of this Opec has a key role in influencing oil prices. So far no Opec member has agreed to any requests to boost output. Russia is not in Opec but has been working with it since 2017 to place limits on oil production in order to maintain earnings for producers. The US is also looking at relaxing Venezuelas oil sanctions. It used to be a key US oil supplier but recently Venezuela has largely been selling its oil to China. What will happen to my heating and fuel bills? Consumers will face rising energy and fuel bills as a result of this war. In the UK household energy bills have been kept in check by an energy price cap. But bills will rise by £700 to about £2000 in April when the cap is increased. They are expected to reach about £3000 when the cap is increased again this autumn. UK petrol and diesel prices have also soared and the government has now announced a cut in fuel duty as motorists struggle with record prices. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Heating bills are set to rise sharply this year in the UK I think if we\re in a world where Russian oil and gas stop flowing to Europe then we\re going to need rationing-style measures says Mr McWilliams. Part of the conversation now is can we tell households to turn their thermostats down one degree which can save a significant chunk of gas.

The first phase of the Homes for Ukraine scheme will see about 30 evacuees arriving in each of the countys seven districts over the next few weeks. It is part of the governments plan to house people escaping the war-torn country with host families in the UK. Charities say the application process is too difficult for those fleeing The latest government figures show that there have been 2700 visas issued for refugees coming to the UK as part of Homes for Ukraine - fewer than 10% of the 28300 applications made in the first 15 days. Under the scheme hosts and guests are required to find each other and make a match before either side can then make the necessary visa application. Lord Harrington refugees minister has admitted the forms took too long to fill in and said the government was trying to speed up the process. Hearts and homes According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service potential hosts will now have their homes checked by local councils to ensure they are suitable. Richard Wright Conservative leader of North Kesteven District Council and county representative on the regional migration board thanked people who has who had offered up their hearts and homes. Lincolnshire is clearly standing ready to welcome as many evacuating Ukrainians as we are able to and to offer the levels of support necessary to assist them and their sponsoring hosts in settling into their new circumstances at a pace that respects their need for time and space he said. Hosts are being supported by the Lincolnshire Resettlement Partnership which expects more arrivals over the coming months. Earlier this month Sir Edward Leigh Conservative MP for Gainsborough was criticised over comments he made during a debate on Ukraine when he said the county had done our bit on immigration from Eastern Europe adding that migration had already led to extreme pressure in terms of housing and jobs.

Alexander was brought to an Israeli field hospital near Lviv last week catatonic. His 24-year-old brain was stuck on the horror hed lived through: on the Russian rockets that hit the apartment block where he was staying with his parents; on the rubble and dead bodies they ran through without even putting on their shoes. It was constant bombing says his father Yevgen. Planes went past every 10 minutes and dropped bombs on Mariupol. People were falling and dying in front of my eyes. We buried people in gardens. The family found shelter with hundreds of others in a cinema near the city centre. Trapped there by Russian attacks they survived on scraps of food from locals or Ukrainian soldiers boiling snow to drink.

We had a car that was damaged but still working she said so we decided to leave the shelter. There was no way out: you could stay and die or you could go and die. You couldn\t even count minutes between the bombs. Memories like these mask their old lives like a second skin.

Mr Putin made the comments during an hour long phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday night the Kremlin said in a statement. But French officials said the Russian leader had agreed to consider plans to evacuate civilians from the city. Russia later proposed a one-day ceasefire for Thursday. The defence ministry said the ceasefire would start at 10:00 local time (08:00 BST) and would allow people to travel westwards to Zaporizhzhia via the Russian-controlled port of Berdyansk. On Thursday morning Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said a convoy of Ukrainian buses was on its way to Mariupol to try to evacuate civilians. She said the International Committee of the Red Cross had confirmed that Russia had agreed to open a humanitarian corridor to the city. Previous attempts to establish a ceasefire in Mariupol have collapsed amid accusations of bad faith from both sides. Russia has also been accused of forcibly relocating thousands of civilians to Russia or Russian-controlled areas. The announcement comes as new satellite photos showed the destruction caused by the shelling. The images released by the Earth observation company Maxar showed that residential areas have been reduced to rubble and highlighted Russian artillery cannons in firing positions on the outskirts of the city. IMAGE SOURCE MAXAR Officials from France\s Elyseé palace called the situation in the city catastrophic and added that civilian populations must be protected and must leave the city if they wish to. They must have access to food aid water and the medicines they need. This very degraded humanitarian situation is linked to the siege of the city by the Russian armed forces the statement said. France along with Turkey Greece and several humanitarian groups have presented Mr Putin with a plan to evacuate the city. Officials said that Mr Putin told Mr Macron that he will think about the proposal. But in its readout of the call the Kremlin appeared to suggest that Mr Putin has provided no such assurances. Russian officials said Mr Putin told the French leader that in order to resolve the difficult humanitarian situation in this city Ukrainian nationalist militants must stop resisting and lay down their arms. The statement added that Mr Putin had given Mr Macron detailed information about measures taken by the Russian military to provide emergency humanitarian assistance and ensure the safe evacuation of civilians from the besieged south-eastern city. Ukraine has accused Russia of forcibly relocating thousands of people from Mariupol to Russian-held territory. IMAGE SOURCE MAXAR Image caption Russian artillery positions on the periphery of Mariupol The call followed claims by the mayor of Mariupol that thousands of people have been killed during the Russian bombardment of the port city. Vadym Boychenko who has been evacuated from the city told the Reuters news agency that almost 5000 people including around 210 children have been killed since Russian shelling began. Matilda Bogner the head of the UN human rights mission in Ukraine told Reuters that she believes there could be thousands of deaths civilian casualties in Mariupol. The International Red Cross humanitarian organisation has confirmed reports that one of its warehouses in the city has been hit by Russian shelling telling the BBC that all supplies in the depot had already been distributed. It added that it no longer has a team on the ground and therefore could not comment on potential extent of casualties or damage. Are you or your family in Mariupol?

Russia said on Tuesday it would cut back operations around Chernihiv and the capital Kyiv in an effort to boost mutual trust in peace talks. But the Chernihiv regions governor told the BBC attacks had continued overnight into Wednesday. Ukraine also said there had been no mass removal of troops. Oleksandr Motuzyanyk a spokesperson for Ukraines armed forces said that though there had been a partial movement of troops from the directions of Kyiv and Chernihiv they had yet to fully abandon attempts to seize or at least surround these cities. Later on Wednesday a US defence official said some Russian troops were leaving the Chernobyl area - home to a former nuclear plant that was the site of the worlds worst nuclear accident in 1986. Chernobyl is an] area where they are beginning to reposition some of their troops - leaving walking away from the Chernobyl facility and moving into Belarus the official said. We think that they are leaving I can\t tell you that they\re all gone the official added. The decommissioned nuclear power station has been under Russian control since late-February a move that has been subject to widespread international condemnation. There have also been concerns over the welfare of workers at the Chernobyl site. Russia says it will curb Kyiv assault as peace talks progress Putin demands Mariupol surrender to end shelling The UN\s Human Rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet meanwhile said Russia\s allegedly indiscriminate attacks on populated areas of Ukraine may amount to war crimes. Addressing the Human Rights Council in Geneva Switzerland on Tuesday she said there were credible allegations that Russia had used cluster munitions in populated areas on multiple occasions. Such weapons are widely banned by an international treaty but neither Russia nor Ukraine are signed up to it. Her office has also verified 77 incidents in which medical facilities had been damaged - including 50 hospitals. Russian attacks continue To date 350 civilians have been killed in the city with 25 to 40 casualties arriving at the hospitals every day Chernihivs mayor told the BBCs Ukrainian Service. Vladyslav Atroshenko said he never thought that as mayor he would ever have to look for extra fridges to store the bodies of the dead because the morgues are full. He never thought he would have to look for additional teams of carpenters to make coffins and for alternative places to bury the dead because the cemetery is too dangerous to travel to. Local officials said Russian shelling continued to hit civilian infrastructure in the city. The entire night was pretty tense regional governor Viacheslav Chaus told the BBC. They attacked Nizhyn and Chernihiv. Mostly Chernihiv. Again part of the civilian infrastructure was destroyed. Chernihiv still has no electricity water supply and heat. It won\t be easy to restore this infrastructure. None of the military buildings were targeted last night. They kept attacking only civilian infrastructure the governor said. The BBC has not been able to confirm this independently but residents of Chernihiv also said the fighting was continuing. This night was rough one resident told the BBC. We heard there was fighting all night in the suburbs away from the city centre. We heard artillery. But there was no aviation tonight. Another resident said shelling was continuing on Wednesday although not as intensely as overnight. Air raid sirens also sounded in Kyiv just a few hours after the announcement that troops would be reduced around the city. Kyivs deputy mayor Mykola Povoroznyk said the capital itself had not been shelled overnight however gunfire had been heard from battles around the city. US and Ukrainian officials say Russia is continuing to reposition forces away from Kyiv probably as part of an effort to refocus on eastern regions. Ukrainian forces have also made advances in recent days retaking areas from Russian forces. In Irpin near Kyiv the mayor said Ukrainian forces had retaken control of the town on Monday and around 200 to 300 civilians had died in the town before it was retaken. Developments on the ground come as Russian and Ukrainian negotiators made no breakthroughs in Tuesday\s peace talks the Kremlin said.

READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Delegations from Moscow and Kyiv held three hours of discussions in Istanbul on Tuesday aimed at bringing to a close more than a month of fighting in Ukraine. Ukraine said it had proposed to become a neutral state in exchange for security guarantees. A key aim of Russias invasion was to stop Ukraine joining the Nato alliance and Russian officials said the talks had moved to a practical stage. Russia\s pledge to cut back military activity was met with scepticism. Ukrainians are not naïve people President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an overnight video address. Mr Zelensky said that initial signs from the peace talks were positive but added that they did not drown out the explosions of Russian shells. Other countries also reacted with caution. US President Joe Biden said: I don\t read anything into it until I see what their actions are. Leaders from UK France Germany and Italy also urged the West not to drop its guard against Russia. In other developments: Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that shelling of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol will only end when Ukrainian troops surrender Germany has declared an early warning over possible gas supply disruption amid a payments stand-off with Russia More than four million people have now fled Ukraine to escape Russias invasion according to the latest United Nations figures.

By Vitaliy Shevchenko BBC Monitoring Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS The situation in Russias media is unprecedented. Restrictions on reporting are increasingly severe and access to almost all independent outlets is blocked or limited - or they censor themselves. Despite this it is still possible to obtain uncensored information in Russia. For most Russians television remains the main source of the news. It is firmly controlled by the Kremlin and pumps out relentless war propaganda. Ukrainians are said to shell their own cities and Russian troops are presented as liberators. The fact that the majority of Russians tune in to TV news means they are inclined to at least hear the Kremlins message - and possibly believe it. There is more variety of opinion in the press but it still largely sticks to the Kremlin line. A stalwart of independent reporting for almost 29 years the Novaya Gazeta newspaper suspended operations on 28 March after receiving warnings from Russias media watchdog Roskomnadzor. IMAGE SOURCE NOVAYA GAZETA Image caption The day after the war began Novaya Gazetas front page exclaimed Russia. Bombs. Ukraine Online most independent news websites are blocked or restricted and so are Facebook Instagram and Twitter. But crucially these blocks are relatively easy to bypass. By now anyone in Russia who is reasonably savvy with computers and smartphones will be familiar with tools such as virtual private networks (VPNs) which help to circumvent the restrictions. They are not yet outlawed in Russia and they are what millions of Russians are using to access uncensored information. War in Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine SURVIVAL: They wont tell me how many bullets were in me SHOOTING: Does video show Ukrainian war crime? READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Reporting on the war is another matter. In early March Russia passed a law under which publishing false information about what the Russian army is doing is punishable by up to 15 years in jail. In practice this means punishment for reporting anything that challenges the Kremlin\s narratives on its campaign in Ukraine. The media are even banned from calling it a war: it is meant to be called a special military operation. As a result some of the few remaining independent media in Russia have started to censor themselves. For example Novaya Gazeta blurred out the anti-war poster held up by a protester who interrupted a live news bulletin on Russian state TV. В эфире программы «Время» за спиной ведущей Екатерины Андреевой появилась девушка с плакатом содержание которого нам запрещают передать Роскомнадзор и Уголовный кодекс.

Lord Harrington refugees minister admitted the forms took too long to fill in and said the government was trying to speed up the process. There has been criticism of the scheme since it was launched. Charities said the process is just too difficult for those fleeing Ukraine. The quickest way to help people would be for the UK to stop requiring visas for those fleeing Ukraine - and would bring it in line with many other countries which have done so since the crisis began said the British Red Cross. The charity said it has had representatives at major airports and arrival hubs since 19 March - but so far only 65 people arriving from Ukraine had been helped. Sonya Sceats chief executive of the Freedom from Torture charity said: In a month where people across the country signed up to welcome more refugees than the government has in 10 years these woeful numbers prove why visa-based schemes are an unsuitable gateway for refugees fleeing Ukraine to reach safety here in the UK. Homeless refugees in UK On top of the 2700 Homes for Ukraine visas a further 22800 visas from 31200 applications have been issued under the Ukraine Family Scheme the Home Office said. These are for those with close relatives living in the UK. But even those with visas are not always being housed. Some refugees have been reporting themselves to councils as being homeless the Local Government Association said. Its chair James Jamieson said it was a big issue. So far 57 councils have said people had presented as homeless - 44 who were part of the family scheme and 56 from Homes from Ukraine. Another 64 had entered through other routes possibly travelling to Ireland and then entering the UK from there he added. How can I offer a UK home to Ukrainian refugees? Sad slow and frustrating Homes for Ukraine launched on 14 March. Its aim is to allow individuals charities community groups and other organisations to sponsor named refugees housing them in their homes or buildings. Those who do not personally know someone fleeing Ukraine have been advised to contact groups who are starting to make connections between individuals to match them to a refugee. The UK requires the refugees to have a visa before they enter unlike other European countries which have waived the checks to speed things up. Those who are granted a visa under the scheme will be eligible to work and can access state benefits and public services for three years. Refugees with a valid Ukrainian international passport can apply online but those without one have to go to a visa application centre - Lord Harrington said approximately 10% of applications so far are having to go to the centres. Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended the government\s overwhelmingly generous record on refugees saying 1000 visas were being processed a day and telling MPs: There is no upper limit to the number that we can take. It came after Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said paperwork is being put ahead of people with one elderly couple on the Polish border with Ukraine being told it was just too complicated to come to the UK.

READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Lord Harrington said he had tried to fill the application form in himself and it had taken nearly an hour - he said while this was from the comfort of his own home on a tablet people were completing it on mobile phones while they were displaced. He told the Levelling Up Housing and Communities Committee progress was already being seen due to Home Office efforts to streamline the visa process and the government was looking at every single step of the process to speed it up. But he added: We need to do more and will be making further improvements to bring people to the UK as quickly as possible. Lord Harrington said in some parts of the form there were four or five separate questions on as many pages suggesting this could be condensed to one page. He added: The response of the British public has been incredible opening their hearts and homes to the people of Ukraine and we must do everything we can to make the most of this extraordinary generosity. The minister said the run rate for applications for both schemes together was anticipated to soon be 15000 a week - within the next three weeks - and that he anticipated the backlog would be cleared quite quickly.

They said a shameful scale of bureaucracy was preventing desperately vulnerable people from reaching sanctuary in the UK calling for clarity on the length of time taken for visas to be issued and how long security checks are taking. The UN refugee agency said more than four million refugees have now fled Ukraine since Russia launched its war in the biggest refugee crisis since World War Two.

I saw that everybody wants to help us and I really feel not as a guest but as a part of a family. Ms Hallan who is a member of Alton Town Council\s resilience fund panel said what the family had endured was heartrending. It\s difficult to fathom that this is not a historical documentary that this is happening to people like us in another county. It\s mindboggling and horrific she said. There is a desperate need to do something practical to help in some small way. My husband and I feel like we can\t just sit here and do nothing.

By Dominic Casciani Legal correspondent BBC News Published 6 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS A former judge at the International Criminal Court has been asked by the UK to help Ukraine investigate potential war crimes by Russia. Sir Howard Morrisons appointment comes as Russia stands accused of violating international law in its invasion of Ukraine. What is a war crime? It may not seem like it but even war has rules as the International Committee of the Red Cross puts it. These are contained in treaties called the Geneva Conventions and a string of other international laws and agreements. Civilians cannot be deliberately attacked - nor can the infrastructure that is vital to their survival. UK war crimes lawyer appointed to help Ukraine Some weapons are banned because of the indiscriminate or appalling suffering they cause - such as anti-personnel landmines and chemical or biological weapons. The sick and wounded must be cared for - including injured soldiers who have rights as prisoners of war. Other laws prohibit torture and genocide - the deliberate attempt to destroy a specific group of people. Serious offences during war such as murder rape or mass persecution of a group are known as crimes against humanity. What allegations of war crimes have there been in Ukraine? Last week US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia had destroyed apartment buildings schools hospitals critical infrastructure civilian vehicles shopping centres and ambulances - actions that the US said amounted to war crimes. The UK has said barbaric and indiscriminate tactics have been used by Russia. In the wake of an attack on a theatre sheltering civilians in the besieged port city of Mariupol Ukrainian officials accused Russia of carrying out a war crime. At the time of the strike - which Russia denies carrying out - the word children was written in giant letters on the ground outside the building. Ukraine previously called Russias air strike on Mariupols hospital a war crime. Three people were killed and 17 staff and patients were injured. Russian troops are also accused of targeting fleeing civilians. Theres mounting evidence that cluster bombs - munitions that separate into lots of bomblets - have hit civilian areas of Kharkiv. IMAGE SOURCE PRIVATE/HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH Image caption Apparent evidence of a cluster bomb sub-munition in Kharkiv passed to Human Rights Watch The UK says Russia has used thermobaric explosives which create a massive vacuum by sucking up oxygen. These are not banned but their deliberate use near civilians would almost certainly break the rules of war. Many experts argue the invasion itself is a crime under the concept of aggressive warfare. Putin has carried out war crimes - Boris Johnson How are suspected war criminals pursued? Each country has a duty to investigate suspected war crimes. Some nations do so more than others. In the UK senior police officers have offered to help gather evidence of potential crimes in Ukraine. How can suspected war criminals be prosecuted? There have been a series of one-off courts since World War Two - including the tribunal investigating war crimes during the break-up of Yugoslavia. A body was also set up to prosecute those responsible for the 1994 Rwanda genocide. IMAGE SOURCE AFP Image caption Théoneste Bagosora died while serving a 35-year sentence for his role in the 1994 Rwandan genocide Today the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) have roles upholding the rules of war. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) rules on disputes between states but cannot prosecute individuals. Ukraine has begun a case against Russia. If the ICJ ruled against Russia the UN Security Council (UNSC) would be responsible for enforcing that. But Russia - one of councils five permanent members - could veto any proposal to sanction it. The International Criminal Court (ICC) The ICC investigates and prosecutes individual war criminals who are not before the courts of individual states. Its the permanent modern successor to Nuremberg which prosecuted key Nazi leaders in 1945. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Nazis prosecuted at the Nuremberg trials included Hermann Goring Rudolf Hess and Joachim von Ribbentrop Nuremberg cemented the principle that nations could set up a special court to uphold international law. Can the ICC prosecute offences in Ukraine? The ICCs chief prosecutor British lawyer Karim Khan QC says there is a reasonable basis to believe war crimes have been carried out in Ukraine. Investigators will look at past and present allegations - going back as far as 2013 before Russias annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. If theres evidence the prosecutor will ask ICC judges to issue arrest warrants to bring individuals to trial in The Hague. But there are practical limitations to its power. The court doesnt have its own police force so relies on individual states to arrest suspects. Like the US Russia is not a member of the court - it pulled out in 2016. President Putin wont extradite any suspects. If a suspect went to another country they could be arrested - but thats a very big if. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Could President Putin or other leaders be prosecuted? Its far easier to pin a war crime on a soldier who commits it than the leader who ordered it. But the ICC can also prosecute the offence of waging aggressive war. This is the crime of an unjustified invasion or conflict beyond justifiable military action in self-defence. It originated at Nuremberg after the judge sent by Moscow convinced the Allies that Nazi leaders should face justice for crimes against peace. However Professor Philippe Sands QC an expert on international law at University College London says the ICC couldnt prosecute Russias leaders for this because the country isnt a signatory to the court. In theory the UN Security Council could ask the ICC to investigate this offence. But again Russia could veto this. So is there any other way to prosecute individuals? The effectiveness of the ICC - and the way international law plays out in practice - depend not just on treaties but politics and diplomacy. And Prof Sands and many other experts argue that like Nuremberg the solution lies once more in diplomacy and international agreement. Hes calling for world leaders to set up a one-off tribunal to prosecute the crime of aggression in Ukraine.

The decision to scale back operations around the capital Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv is the first sign of tangible progress from talks. But it is unclear how extensive any reduction in military activity might be and Ukraine remains sceptical. The US and UK also said the pledge should be treated with caution. On Tuesday Russia\s deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin said the country would radically by several times reduce the military activity around Kyiv and Chernihiv. He added that there had been progress on the neutrality and non-nuclear status of Ukraine which are two key concerns for Moscow. But Russia\s pledge to scale back its forces was met with scepticism. Ukrainians are not naive people President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an overnight video address. We can say that the signals... are positive but those signals do not drown out the explosions or Russian shells he added. We\ve only seen a small number begin to move away from Kyiv Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said adding that people should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine. The UK Defence Ministry also warned that Russia will likely seek to divert combat power from the north to their offensive in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east. Russia has already refocused its campaign on Ukraines eastern regions. It has suffered a series of setbacks to the north of the capital Kyiv and is also seeking to capture a land corridor which stretches along the south coast to the Russian border. The key word - scepticism The discussions lasted about three hours. Very little was leaked and nearly all media were kept away in a packed area on a pavement. The key points became clear as members of the Ukrainian delegation came out onto the street an hour before the expected finish. The negotiators said they had proposed to Russia that Ukraine adopt a neutral status in exchange for security guarantees - an international mechanism where guarantor countries would act to protect Ukraine in future. In return Kyiv would not join Nato a key Russian demand. This was not a new pledge but it was spelt out in the clearest detail yet. Many are sceptical about what Russias announcement about reducing military operations actually means; whether its a pledge to pull back or merely an acceptance it has already failed in those areas and will instead turn its full force further east. Western countries therefore are saying they will judge Russia by its actions and not its words. Read more from Tom here. During the ceasefire talks on Tuesday Ukraine proposed to become a neutral state in exchange for security guarantees. A key aim of Russias invasion was to stop Ukraine joining the Nato alliance and Russian officials said the talks had moved to a practical stage. Ukrainian negotiator Oleksandr Chaly told reporters that its offer of neutrality - which means it would not ally itself militarily with others - was a chance to restore the territorial integrity and security of Ukraine through diplomatic and political means. Russian forces have encircled Chernihiv where officials say up to 400 people have been killed and some 130000 residents are without heating electricity or water supplies. Russia\s chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said talks had been meaningful and Ukraine\s proposals on neutrality would be put to President Vladimir Putin. However he made clear that before a presidential summit could happen a treaty would have to be drafted and approved by negotiators and then signed by foreign ministers. This is not a ceasefire but this is our aspiration gradually to reach a de-escalation of the conflict at least on these fronts Mr Medinsky told Russian state news agency Tass.

Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said this framework would enable a ceasefire to be agreed without Crimea and the eastern regions being settled. The proposals would also enable Ukraine to join the European Union while barring it from becoming part of Natos defensive military alliance.]Newsday: Ukraine: Russia trying to mislead with withdrawal pledge,Moscow to scale back military operations Kyiv and Chernihiv ‘to boost mutual trust’,UnknownUkraine Refugees: Volunteers from Hillingdon organise aid effort,Londoners from Hillingdon are providing food and supplies to refugees leaving Ukraine.,]Newspaper headlines: Putin 'wants to divide Ukraine' and royal reforms,"Claims that Moscow hopes to split Ukraine in two ""like Korea"" and plans for a royal shake-up lead the papers",Newspaper headlines: Putin wants to divide Ukraine and royal reforms By BBC News Staff Published 6 days ago Share IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Five-year-old Egor sits in a shelter set up in a ballroom in Romania after being forced to flee his home in the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv by Russian shelling The war in Ukraine now in its second month continues to dominate the front pages.

By Soraya Ali BBC News Published 4 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE DESMOND MUOKWUDO Image caption Desmond Chinaza Muokwudo was a welder in Nigeria before studying in Ukraine Desmond Chinaza Muokwudo a 30-year-old Nigerian student who has recently fled Ukraine spent 11 years saving up for an education in Europe. Once a pipeline welder from Anambra state he dreamt of studying international relations - but he struggled with unemployment amid a recession in 2016. It was only after his parents decided to sell their small plot of land that he managed to raise enough funds to pursue his dream. He finally enrolled last year at university and had only spent three months in Ukraine when Russia launched its full-scale invasion. My parents have nothing left they can\t support me he explained over the phone from his temporary accommodation in Berlin Germany sounding defeated. My government just tells me to come back home but there\s nothing waiting for me in Nigeria. Mr Muokwudo is one of the estimated 16000 African students who were living in Ukraine and are now scrambling to continue their studies. Many had a traumatic time fleeing amid reports of racial abuse at the border. Media caption Nigerian student who fled Ukraine: They are only helping Ukrainians. Hundreds have returned home on repatriation flights though exact numbers are unclear but thousands like Mr Muokwudo are likely to still be in Europe. I have sacrificed too much to get here. I have to stay in Europe and I have to get an education Mr Muokwudo said. Universities across the world have extended a helping hand to students fleeing Ukraine in the form of guaranteed places discounted tuition fees and relaxed visa requirements. African officials have also increased diplomatic efforts to get assurances for their students with foreign ministers meeting with their European counterparts to broker deals. Up to 250 university places are being offered in Hungary to stranded medical students according to Ghanaian officials - and Ghanas government reportedly has a deal with Grenada for 200 to be enrolled at the St Georges University of Medicine. Semmelweis University in Hungary which is allowing medical students to continue their studies for free until the war is over says it has received more than 2000 applications in just a few weeks mainly from Africans. However many students say that these offers are granted on a case-by-case basis and wrapped up in red tape. They largely depend on what degree students are undertaking how many years they have already completed and how much they can still afford to pay. Mr Muokwudo complained that some universities would not take non-Ukrainians. \We only take Ukrainian citizens\ that\s what I\ve been told he said referring to a policy at Tallinn University in Estonia. The university confirmed that only Ukrainians could apply outside the usual admission process but said that international students were still welcome to apply the regular way. Online seminars The war has left many of these students with difficult choices - and left some with the prospect of not qualifying. Nigeria has welcomed back more than 1000 people mainly students from Ukraine according to a government tally. Among them was 22-year-old medical student Fehintola Moses Damilola who was trapped in the besieged city of Sumy for weeks. I\m just happy to be safe and with my parents he said speaking to the BBC from his home in Oyo state. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Some universities in Ukraine - this is one in Kharkiv - are trying to continue classes online despite the war It is his first visit home in more than five years - and he is just one semester away from becoming a qualified doctor. This is still likely to happen as he is lucky to be able to rely on online classes which despite the ongoing conflict some Ukrainian universities are offering using the digital infrastructure developed during pandemic lockdowns. In Nigerias Kaduna state Firdausi Mohammed Usman has also begun online classes. The 22-year-old medical student is in her fifth year at the National Medical University in Kharkiv an eastern Ukrainian city that has faced nightly shelling. She said that the professors were holding online practical seminars and some appeared on the screen. Her teachers are being understandably tight-lipped about their exact location for safety reasons. Some have fled the country but others are still in Ukraine and leaving basement bomb shelters to host classes upstairs. They don\t want us to all drop out or transfer somewhere else - otherwise the university might be forced to close down forever. We don\t have access to our transcripts academic records] so this is the best option for now. I dont want to go backwards Mr Damilola who was president of the Nigerian Students Union in Sumy also stressed the importance of online classes for medical students in their final year like him. IMAGE SOURCE FEHINTOLA MOSES DAMILOLA Image caption Fehintola Moses Damilola seen here on right with fellow students had been in Ukraine since he was 17 It might be hard with this internet but I only have one semester left and I can\t afford to start at a new university he said struggling to be heard as the WhatsApp line kept breaking up. He also felt that finishing his degree in Nigeria would mean going backwards academically. Marcel Chidera from Nigerias Enugu state is continuing his education in Poland having turned down a repatriation flight organised by his government. He is not the only one. Angola arranged a flight for its citizens to return home from Warsaw. It expected to take home 277 people but only 30 boarded. Going back home without a degree was not an option Mr Chidera said from his temporary accommodation in the Polish capital. The 25-year-old counted himself lucky as he had only completed a Ukrainian language course so was free to start a new degree. Most courses in Poland are offered in English and open to international students though the costs and admission requirements are often tougher than in Ukraine. He has found a discounted business management degree at a Polish university - and considered himself better off than others in his family in Nigeria where university lecturers have been on a nationwide strike since 14 February. My siblings are studying in Nigeria right now. They\re not even in classes because of the strikes he said. Opportunity for Africa Higher education across Africa has long suffered from insufficient funding a shortage of qualified staff and low investment in research and development according to local NGOs and UN agencies. Only 60 African universities made the top 1500 listed globally according to World University Rankings. South Africa home to the continents top universities has stepped up efforts to help returning students. Dr Mamphela Ramphele the former vice-chancellor of the University of Cape Town the highest-ranking school in Africa called it an opportunity to rethink the way we address support to young people. That sentiment has appealed to students like Zoe Inutu in Zambia who are searching for options at home. She was two years into her public relations degree in Zaporizhzhia south-east Ukraine when the war began. My transcripts are stuck in Ukraine so I will probably have to start a new degree she said. I will go anywhere that will take me including Africa as long as I am safe.

He was seen talking to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who is mediating in the talks in Istanbul. Reports surfaced hours earlier that Mr Abramovich and two Ukrainian negotiators had shown poisoning symptoms after talks in early March. Mr Abramovich is known to have spent weeks in a mediation role flying between Moscow and Kyiv. The Chelsea football club owner was said to have suffered sore eyes and peeling skin but had now recovered reports say. A Wall Street Journal report suggested he and the Ukrainian negotiators had been targeted by Russian hardliners in Kyiv on 3 March but a Ukrainian presidential official later said the two Ukrainians were fine and one had said the story was false. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov poured scorn on the report on Tuesday as untrue and part of an information war. Ukraines Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba however told national TV hours before the talks that he had advised his colleagues attending negotiations with Russia not to eat or drink anything. Russian state news agency Ria Novosti released a picture showing Mr Abramovich talking to the Turkish president and Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu at the meeting.

They were not at the main table of the Russian and Ukrainian delegations. The exact nature of Mr Abramovichs role in the talks is unclear although Ukrainian media said he was there as a neutral party. The Kremlin spokesman stressed he was not an official member of the Russian delegation in Istanbul but had been involved in enabling contacts between the two delegations. Ukraine\s UK ambassador Vadym Prystaiko was scathing about his presence in Istanbul: I have no idea what Mr Abramovich is claiming or doing. He is not a part of the negotiation team he told the BBC. I don\t know if he\s buying his way out somehow or if he\s really useful that\s very difficult to tell.

A number of enemies of the Kremlin have suffered mysterious poisonings in recent years including Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny who was attacked with a nerve agent in Siberia and activist activist Vladimir Kara-Murza who survived two incidents.

Bombs bloodshed trauma. No school for your children no healthcare for your parents no safe roof over your head in many parts of the country. Would you try to run? Ten million Ukrainians have according to the United Nations. Most seek refuge in other areas of Ukraine believed to be safer. But more than three and a half million people have fled over the border. They are mainly women and children as men under the age of 60 are obliged by the Ukrainian government to stay put and fight. Displaced and disoriented often with no idea where to go next refugees are forced to put their trust in strangers. The chaos of war is now behind them but the truth is theyre not entirely safe outside Ukraine either. For predators and human traffickers the war in Ukraine is not a tragedy UN Secretary General António Guterres warned on Twitter. It\s an opportunity - and women and children are the targets. Trafficking rings are notoriously active in Ukraine and neighbouring countries in peace time. The fog of war is perfect cover to increase business. Karolina Wierzbińska a coordinator at Homo Faber a human rights organisation based in Lublin told me children were a huge concern. Many youngsters were travelling out of Ukraine unaccompanied she said. Patchy registration processes in Poland and other border regions - especially at the start of the war - meant children disappeared their current whereabouts unknown. My colleagues and I headed down to the Polish-Ukrainian border to see for ourselves. At a train station well known for refugee arrivals we found a hive of activity. Dazed-looking women and crying children were all around. Image caption Women and their children have been arriving at the border area Many were being comforted and offered hot food from steaming industrial-sized cooking pots by an army of volunteers wearing high-vis gilets. So far so well organised right? Not quite. We met Margherita Husmanov a Ukrainian refugee from Kyiv in her early 20s. She arrived at the border two weeks ago but decided to stay on to help stop fellow refugees falling into the wrong hands. I asked her if she felt vulnerable. Yes she told me. That\s especially why I worry about their safety. The women and children come here from a terrible war. They don\t speak Polish or English. They don\t know what\s going on and they believe what anyone tells them. Anyone can turn up at this station. The first day I volunteered we saw three men from Italy. They were looking for beautiful women to sell into the sex trade. I called the police and it turned out I was right. It wasn\t paranoia. It\s horrible. Image caption Margherita Husmanov is a refugee turned volunteer Margherita says local officials are a bit more organised now. Police regularly patrol the station. The people (mainly men were told) with cardboard signs to tempting destinations so present in the first couple of weeks of refugee arrivals have largely disappeared. But as we find out from a number of sources other ill-intentioned individuals are now posing as high-vis-wearing volunteers. Elena Moskvitina spoke out on Facebook to raise awareness. Shes now safely in Denmark so we chatted at length via Skype. Her experience is chilling. She and her children crossed into neighbouring Romania from war-torn Ukraine. They were looking for a lift away from the border. What she described as fake volunteers at a refugee centre asked where she was staying. They turned up later in the day and aggressively told her Switzerland was the best place to go and that theyd give her a lift there with a van full of other women. Elena told me the men looked at her and her daughter sleazily. Her daughter was petrified. They asked her to show them her son who was in another room. They looked him up and down she said. They then insisted she travel with no-one else except them and they got angry when she asked to see their ID cards. To get the men away from her family Elena promised to meet them when the other women were in their van. But as soon as they left she told me she grabbed her children and ran. Image caption Elżbieta Jarmulska offers safe passage to Ukrainian refugees Elżbieta Jarmulska a feisty Polish entrepreneur is the founder of the Women Take The Wheel Initiative. Her aim she says is to provide Ukrainian refugees with a bubble of safety. Those women have been through so much already walking or driving their way through a war zone and then they are exposed to fear and exploitation here? I have no words for what that must be like she says. By now she has recruited more than 650 Polish amazing women as she describes them driving backwards and forwards as often as they can to the Polish-Ukrainian border in order to offer refugees safe passage. I accompany Elżbieta better known as Ela to a refugee centre where she makes a point of showing her ID card and proof of residence to officials before she asks if anyone wants a lift to Warsaw. Her car was full in moments. The passengers: refugee Nadia and her three children. Ela settled the family into her thoughtfully stocked car offering the small children water chocolate and motion-sickness tablets if they needed them. Image caption Nadia and her children are grateful for the lift Nadia meanwhile told me of her dangerous journey out of Ukraine from Kharkiv. Now in Poland she was so relieved she said to have a female driver. Shed heard of the risks of trafficking and exploitation on Ukrainian radio. But she came anyway. Her home was being shelled she said. The risks of war were more immediate. Ela has the refugees best interests at heart. But leaving the border safely doesnt mean the danger is over for them. Most we spoke to hoped to go home as soon as the violence ends. But over the next days weeks even months they need somewhere to sleep to eat to send their children to school as well as a job to properly support themselves. Those needs make refugees vulnerable. EU leaders have unanimously approved a measure to open up the job market schools and access to health care for Ukrainians but as human rights groups point out refugees need help to get registered and be informed of their rights. One of the volunteers I met at the Polish-Ukrainian border told me that when youre down and out friendless and in need of money you can all too easily end up doing things you would have never imagined. This woman was lured into prostitution when she was younger. And that she says is a large part of the reason shes helping Ukrainian refugees now. I want to protect them. To warn them she told me. She asked me not to reveal her name. She\s since turned her life around and doesn\t want her children to know about her past. Image caption Refugees are all too vulnerable to exploitation Five weeks into Russias onslaught in Ukraine processes across Europe screening those claiming to help Ukrainians are still far from foolproof. Organised crime (including sex and organ trafficking and frequently slave labour) is not the only menace. Refugees are exploited by individuals too. People in Poland Germany the UK and elsewhere have opened up their homes to refugees most with the best of intentions. But sadly not all. We found a post on social media from a Ukrainian woman who fled to Düsseldorf in Germany. The man who offered her a room confiscated her ID papers and demanded she clean his house for free. He then started to make sexual advances as well. She refused - and he kicked her out on the street. Irena Dawid-Olczyk chief executive of the Warsaw branch of anti-trafficking NGO La Strada told me the story was all too familiar. That kind of thing happens war or no war she told me. But an avalanche of conflict-scarred women and children bursting out of Ukraine means that exploitation and abuse cases escalate. She cites teenage refugees as a particular concern. We all know teenagers don\t we? They\re insecure. They want acceptance and recognition she says. And if they are refugees who are far from home and friends they\re even easier to exploit. Girls might love attention lavished on them by older men. Or they\ll be introduced to a cool girl their own age who has great clothes and invites them to parties. That\s how it starts. Don\t forget it\s not only men who are pimps traffickers and abusers. Image caption Refugees are given leaflets offering help The push factors for Ukrainian women to accept seemingly generous online offers to escape their difficulties also increase manyfold in war time. Without revealing identities Irena reels off case after case that La Strada Poland is working on - Ukrainian girls offered plane tickets to Mexico Turkey the UAE without ever having met the men inviting them. My colleagues are trying to persuade a 19-year-old girl not to join her friend at a man\s house she says. She knows her friend has been beaten. But the man calls her on her mobile says sweet things and offers her presents. If they insist on going we beg the girls to at least register with the local authorities. If they don\t they have our phone number. I hope they can call us if they need us. Governments across Europe have pledged solidarity with Ukraine. Human rights groups want them to take better care of those running for their lives. They need protection.]Global News Podcast: Western leaders urge caution on Russia’s pledge to reduce attacks on Ukraine,The US and UK warn actions are more important than words,UnknownStaffordshire teacher 'over the moon' to be home from Ukraine,"Harry Richardson, from Leek, Staffordshire, hid from Russian advances in a university basement.",Staffordshire teacher over the moon to be home from Ukraine Published 4 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption Harry Richardson and his wife Alina sheltered from Russian advances in a university basement A British man forced to shelter from Russias invasion of Ukraine said he was over the moon to be home.

Plans in secret Hundreds of former British soldiers who have completed their time in the armed services have said they want to go to Ukraine to fight or help with medical or humanitarian efforts. Many told the BBC earlier this month that they are getting mixed messages from the government about whether they should go. The legal position at home is vague. In February Foreign Secretary Liz Truss encouraged people to go only for Downing Street to advise people with no combat experience not to.

Elliot Former Grenadier Guardsman Kieran is not planning on a long war. He only wants to stay in Ukraine for two or three weeks before returning home explaining that he has childcare responsibilities and a birthday coming up. I\m not expecting to get to the front line in that time. But if everyone chips in to help then it takes the weight off the people that are really working hard right at the front line. By contrast Elliott says hes in Ukraine for as long as it takes. I\ll help out wherever I can in the field he says. Anywhere from back to front.

So they board a regular bus and end up chatting to Julia who has just dropped her daughter at the border to travel into the European Union as a refugee. Thank you very much that you have come here to help she tells them. Our Ukrainian soldiers are also very brave very brave. The men now have a choice to make. One option is to sign up with Ukraines International Legion. That could mean committing to stay for the duration of the war. In return theyd get paid the same as rank-and-file Ukrainian soldiers. A more flexible choice is to remain unattached and link up with other British former soldiers who are already fighting at the front line bypassing what might turn out to be painful Ukrainian bureaucracy. As they prepare to leave I ask whether it was the excitement of war that had brought them to Ukraine. Anyone who thinks we\re war junkies or war tourists needs to stick to watching the news CJ says. There is no excitement to war. There\s nothing nice about dead kids at the side of the road.

A diplomatic note from the Ukrainian embassy in Delhi to Nepals government says numerous international sports federations have barred Russian athletes. Taking into consideration the above the esteemed Nepalese side is kindly requested to ban Russian mountaineering teams until the end of the] Russian invasion into Ukraine the letter reads. But officials in Nepal say they are continuing to issue permits to anyone abiding by the governments rules and regulations There has been no change in our policy so far the director general of Nepal\s tourism department Taranath Adhikari told the BBC. We believe our mountains are global assets and any countries\ citizens willing to visit them for attainment of peace should be allowed to do so - as long as they do it within our legal provisions. The Ukrainian embassy in Delhi says it made its request to the Nepalese embassy in the Indian capital on 21 March but Nepalese embassy officials told the BBC they had received no communication on the issue. For the spring climbing season which usually lasts until the end of May one Russian climber has received a permit to climb Annapurna I (8091m) while eight others have been given permits for peaks below 6500m. We have carried on with our usual policy. Moreover the government has not said anything in this regard so we have not taken any new decision says Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA) president Santa Bir Lama.

Oleg Ivanchenko a Ukrainian mountain guide was planning to climb Mount Everest and Mount Lhotse this spring with two of his clients but had to cancel after the Russian invasion. I know some people say mountains are sacred and it is not a place for politics but we expect support from Russian mountaineers as well and they can protest - or at least not climb and stay in Russia he says. No Ukrainian climbers are now expected this spring. We had around 35 climbers from Ukraine coming in for different mountains including Everest but all of them have cancelled says Mingma Sherpa chairman of Seven Summit Treks a mountaineering and trekking operator in Nepal.

Of the 135 climbers in these teams only one is from Russia. More permits may be issued before mountaineers usually begin their final ascent in May so the total number could change. However expedition operators say the war has caused a significant decline in business. Last year in the spring and autumn climbing seasons 49 Russians and 19 Ukrainians were registered on Nepalese mountains higher than 8000m according to the Himalayan Database which records data related to mountaineering in the Nepalese Himalayas. Out of them 14 Russian and six Ukrainian climbers were on Everest. A record number of more than 400 foreign climbers were given permits for Everest alone in 2021. But permits have been issued for only three Everest expedition of 16 climbers this spring season which is traditionally busier than the autumn. Officials with the Expedition Operators Association of Nepal say they are neutral while dealing with mountaineers. We are professional operators and we serve our clients irrespective of their nationalities says association president Dambar Parajuli.

Ireland Belgium the Netherlands and the Czech Republic issued expulsion orders to a total of 43 embassy staffers on Tuesday afternoon. The move follows similar actions taken by other EU members including Poland in the past week. Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmès told MPs that the expulsions were related to our national security. Speaking to parliament Ms Wilmès said that 21 members of staff at the Russian embassy in Brussels and at the consulate in Antwerp had been asked to leave the country giving them two weeks to depart. She added that the move was made in conjunction with Belgium\s neighbour the Netherlands whose foreign ministry said it was expelling 17 Russian diplomats it considered to be secretly active as intelligence officers. Irelands Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Micheál Martin told MPs that his government had expelled four Russian diplomats after receiving security advice from its intelligence officials. Mr Martin said the officials had been asked to leave the state because their activities are not in accordance with the international standards of diplomatic behaviour. Russia\s embassy in Dublin said it rejected the groundless decision adding that it would deteriorate further Russian-Irish relations. Meanwhile a Czech official told the AFP news agency that the diplomat expelled from Prague was Russias deputy ambassador. Together with our Allies we are reducing the Russian intelligence presence in the EU the Czech foreign ministry tweeted. On Wednesday Poland expelled 45 accredited diplomats for engaging in suspected espionage in the country. Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski wrote on Twitter that Polish intelligence officials were dismantling the Russian special services network in our country. And earlier this month Bulgaria Lithuania Latvia and Estonia expelled a total of 20 Russian embassy staffers in connection with activities contrary to their diplomatic status. Russia has tended to respond to such decisions with reciprocal moves and earlier today announced the expulsion of 10 diplomats from Estonia Latvia and Lithuania.

The governor of the Lviv region Maksym Kozytskyi said five people had been injured and that rocket fire had hit a fuel storage facility and a factory. Lviv has so far escaped much of the shelling that has come to be a part of daily life in other parts of Ukraine. It has also become a hub for hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing other parts of the country. The alleged Russian attack came as US President Joe Biden delivered a speech in Warsaw Poland some 250 miles (400km) from Lviv. In it he addressed the Russian people on their leader President Vladimir Putin telling them: For God\s sake this man cannot remain in power. The Kremlin responded that was not for the US leader to say. That\s not for Biden to decide. The president of Russia is elected by Russians a spokesman said. A White House official later said that Mr Biden was not calling for regime change but making the point that Vladimir Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours in the region.

Then three powerful explosions and thick plumes of smoke could be seen from the distance. Hours later another attack. It all happened a day after Russia said it was focusing its invasion of Ukraine on the east. Lviv is in the extreme opposite. And this distance from the worst of Russias aggression where people have been under unrelenting bombing and shelling turned this city into something like a safe heaven.

The comment was made during a meeting with Ukrainian refugees helping with the humanitarian relief effort in Poland - where more than two million Ukrainian refugees have now fled. A spokesperson for Mr Putin cited by Russian state news agency Tass said the comment narrowed the prospects for mending ties between the two countries. Earlier Mr Biden met Ukraines foreign and defence ministers Dmytro Kuleba and Oleksii Reznikov. The two Ukrainians ministers trip out of Ukraine to Poland was seen as a possible sign that confidence in Ukraines fightback against Russia is growing. During the talks the US\s unwavering commitment to Ukraine\s sovereignty and territorial integrity was discussed according to a US state department spokesperson.

Sources close to the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich said he had suffered symptoms of a suspected poisoning following peace talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border earlier this month. The Chelsea FC owner - who has now recovered - reportedly suffered sore eyes and peeling skin. A report in the Wall Street Journal said the alleged poisoning was orchestrated by hardliners in Russia who wanted to sabotage the talks. Both Ukrainian and American officials have played down the reports.

The couple and probably everyone else left in Chernihiv spend most of their time hiding behind thick walls. Thank God we have them Anna said. Their son who is 12 rarely ventures outside. He\s in panic. Many children are afraid of going out. Chernihiv located on the banks of the Desna River was one of the first targets for Russian troops who invaded Ukraine from Belarus hoping to quickly reach the capital Kyiv just 144km (90 miles) to the south. A month on that has not happened and they have now effectively surrounded the city. Civilians are trapped with no running water electricity and heating and under relentless bombing and shelling.

Netblocks said it saw a collapse in connectivity to 13% of pre-war levels. However Ukrainian users on different internet providers who spoke to the BBC reported no problems. Ukrtelecom says it is the countrys biggest provider of fixed internet in terms of geographical coverage but second after Kyivstar in terms of number of clients. It told the BBC it had been operating at about 80% of its full coverage because of damage caused by the Russian invasion.

But how much is fact backed up by intelligence reports and arrests and how much is something closer to understandable paranoia fuelled by social media rumours about mysterious lights and signs? It was my neighbours from this stairwell who came to see me. They were scared about security said Bohdan Mylko a 22-year-old engineer sharing an apartment on the northern edge of Odesa. Fifteen minutes later the police were at his door asking about a red light in his bedroom window. It\s paranoia based on fake news about red lights being a sign to the Russians. I had to go to the police station and get my documents checked make a statement and get my photo taken. The police realised that I\m just a normal guy and let me go home. I\m not trying to help the Russians said Mylko holding up the set of flashing fairy lights that prompted the police\s intervention. Image caption Elderly people are among patrols at night asking to check the documents of people they encounter Moments after we visited him one evening shortly before curfew we were stopped on the street outside by a group of residents who asked to see our documents. You could be Russians said an elderly woman who gave her name as Valya. What are you doing here? We have small children. We don\t want anything to happen to them. Maybe someone will drop a bomb here tomorrow said another woman as the wail of an air raid siren rose over the apartment complex. Such concerns are understandable in a city and a country still reeling from the shock of Russias invasion. Similar behaviour has been noted in many other conflicts from Syria to Chechnya and beyond. This is not paranoia. There are Russian agents and citizens of Ukraine working against us. That\s a fact said Capt Volodymir Kalina from the Odesa police. But he acknowledged there was a strong element of disinformation involved and accused Russia of deliberately trying to stir up public fear. They\re trying to distract us to make us pay attention to the wrong places - to clear us from one part of the city so they can carry out their work in another area he said. Image caption Dmitro covered a black arrow on a wall in case it was a sign for Russian troops Along the coast a few kilometres south of Odesa citys historic centre in an area known for its nightclubs and beach bars retired businessman Dmitro Novak 71 was beginning his morning shift with a neighbourhood patrol. He pointed to a black arrow painted on a wall and explained he had covered it in case it was a sign for Russian troops. A few minutes later he stopped on a set of steps beside a large empty office building overlooking the sea. I saw a big light there. It was directed towards the night sky. My neighbours saw it too. It was on the roof of this building. For sure it was a signal to the Russian fleet. Some kind of signal. We called the authorities and they came immediately and the light was switched off. So now we\re looking carefully around for any other signals or marks. Everybody is alert. We\re changing shifts every two hours said Novak. Last week Russian naval artillery shelled the area with some missiles landing just off the beach and several others hitting residential homes but causing no casualties. Image caption Ukrainian media has broadcast numerous videos showing police arresting alleged Russian saboteurs Hanna Shelest a prominent analyst in Odesa who advises the Ukrainian parliament on security issues backed up concerns that Ukrainians or Russians were providing information to the Russian military. The first aim is the storage of weapons and ammunition in town in case street fighting starts here she explained. The second is to spread disinformation and gossip. The third aim is to mark directions in the city with signs for which way to go in case there is an amphibious landing by the Russians. And the fourth is to mark targets - either visually or with electronic signals - for artillery or airstrikes. Ukrainian media has broadcast numerous videos showing police arresting alleged Russian saboteurs. President Volodymyr Zelensky was also shown handing out medals to a group of police security agents credited with apprehending suspected Russian saboteurs and reconnaissance groups. But it is worth noting that for all the fear and suspicion aroused by such reports the evidence so far suggests that a few isolated Russian cells have so far been remarkably unsuccessful and that Ukrainian public opinion - directly contradicting Russian propaganda - has hardened and united against the Kremlins invasion. The idea that partisans or fifth columnists might be activated effectively in Ukraine would appear to have been entirely fanciful. Ukraine\s security services are definitely monitoring those under suspicion. And we already know some people have been arrested. But as for anything more serious - it is probably not their time yet said Dr Shelest.

The US has said that although these oil imports do not violate sanctions support for Russia...is support for an invasion that obviously is having a devastating impact. Where does India get its oil? After the US and China India is the worlds third-largest consumer of oil over 80% of which is imported. In 2021 India bought about 12 million barrels of oil from Russia only 2% of its total imports. By far the largest supplies last year came from the Middle East with significant quantities also from the US and Nigeria. In January and February India didnt import any oil from Russia. But contracts for March and April have already reached six million barrels according to data compiled by Kpler a commodities research group. The Indian government says even if it buys more oil from Russia it would still be a drop literally a drop in a larger bucket of its oil imports globally. Whats the deal India is getting? Following its invasion of Ukraine there are now fewer buyers for Russias Ural crude oil and its price has fallen. While we don\t know the exact price that India is paying the Urals discount to Brent crude the global benchmark] in the last week has widened to about $30 per barrel says Matt Smith an analyst at Kpler. These two types of crude normally sell at a similar price. But at one point in March as the price of Urals continued to drop the difference between them reached an all-time record he adds. So India and China are likely to purchase at least some of this Russian] crude at a significant discount he says. Can the world manage without Russian oil and gas? IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption India imports more than 80% of its oil Whats the impact of financial sanctions? Indias big refining companies are facing a challenge trying to finance these discounted purchases because of sanctions on Russian banks. Its a problem facing trade in both directions. Financial analysts Bloomberg estimate that Indian exporters to Russia are currently awaiting payments equivalent to about $500m (£381.5m). One of the options India is looking at is a transaction system based on local currencies where Indian exporters to Russia get paid in roubles instead of dollars or euros. Where else is India looking to buy oil? Indias oil imports from the US have gone up significantly since February according to analysts at Refinitiv. However market analysts say this may not be sustainable in the future as the US seeks to use its domestic oil production to replace supplies from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. There are also suggestions that trade with Iran could resume under a barter mechanism which Indian oil refiners could use to buy its oil. This arrangement stopped three years ago when the US reimposed sanctions on Iran. But this is unlikely to resume without a wider deal reached in international negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme.

It also reflects growing local confidence in the course of the war against Russia at least here on the Black Sea coast. The city is coming alive I feel. I think the fear is going away a bit. People believe in our army which is protecting us and feel comfortable feel safe. I don\t think the Russian army is winning said Alexander Hodosevich a drummer for an instrumental psychedelic band sitting with a group of friends after finishing an hour-long set at the More Music club. The venue has just reopened staging live (and live-streamed) concerts in the late afternoons to give audiences enough time to get home before curfew. IMAGE SOURCE BBC NEWS Image caption Bars restaurants and clubs are re-opening in Odesa North of the city on windswept beach popular with summer tourists razor wire land mines and sandbags now block all access to the sea. I\ve seen Russian ships. But they pulled back. They know we\re a threat to them. We\ve had a lot of incoming fire. From rockets over there. There have also been drones dropping bombs. But they won\t succeed here. Let them try to land - we\ll make them pay a heavy price said Anatolii 27 a Ukrainian soldier manning an anti-aircraft gun. There is a logic to Odesas growing confidence. Russias advance along the Black Sea coast has stalled. Ukrainian troops in the city of Mykolaiv have not only protected their strategic bridge but are now reported to be pushing Russian forces back to the east. In Kherson the first city to be seized by Russian troops a month ago occupying security forces are now being accused of using excessive force against civilian protesters and of abducting or arresting local leaders to try to contain popular unrest. When they started using this gas smoke pellets and stun grenades I started running. That was really scary said Lada Danik a university lecturer in Kherson speaking on a Skype call. The Russians] started kidnapping people going to their apartments and the places people live - protesters and activists. It seems they\re using more threatening techniques and tactics. I think they\re in panic she said. In Odesa there is enormous gratitude for the way Ukrainian soldiers in places like Mykolaiv and Voznesensk have stood their ground and blocked Russian land forces from moving further west. But what about an amphibious landing? The small town which blocked Russias big plans The security analyst Hanna Shelest believes that Odesa could have fallen to Russia if pro-Moscow leaders had engineered a surrender in the opening days of the war. But that option is now closed and she believes Russian troops would struggle to attack from the sea without first establishing a base on land. It seems to me that it\s just impossible. If you look at the technical conditions the strategic terrain Odesa has never been a city for easy taking (from the sea). History has proved it several times she said. In the meantime the citys vast catacombs - perhaps 2500km (1553 miles) of underground tunnels dug over the course of the past two centuries - are being prepared once again as possible air raid shelters. IMAGE SOURCE BBC NEWS Image caption The catacombs were used by fleeing families during both World Wars Mattresses and food supplies now sit in dark corners in the musty labyrinth-like network which was used by fleeing families and by partisans in both world wars as well as Russias Civil War. There\s graffiti here from the 1940s. This one says \Death to Fascists\ said caver and local historian Maxim Baranestski 46 waving his flashlight at lettering on a sand-coloured stone wall deep underground. But the firm hope in Odesa is that history will not repeat itself and that Russias push west along the coast will remain thwarted. Are you in Ukraine? Do you have relatives or friends who are there?

In an interview with independent Russian journalists Volodymyr Zelensky said any such deal would have to be put to a referendum in Ukraine. He has made similar comments before but rarely so forcefully. The news comes as the negotiations between the two countries are set to resume this week in Turkey. Security guarantees and neutrality non-nuclear status of our state. We are ready to go for it. This is the most important point Mr Zelensky said in the 90-minute video call. Neutrality means a country does not ally itself militarily with others. Mr Zelensky said that any potential agreement would require a face-to-face meeting with President Putin and that effective security guarantees that Ukraine would not come under attack were essential. The Ukrainian leader - speaking in Russian throughout - added that Russias invasion has caused the destruction of Russian-speaking cities in Ukraine. Later in an overnight video address to his nation Mr Zelensky said Ukraine sought peace without delay. Russias President Vladimir Putin has long demanded a neutral Ukraine and guarantees that it would not join the Nato military alliance. After the country achieved independence in 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed it has gradually veered towards the West - to both the EU and Nato. But Russia\s leader aims to reverse that seeing the fall of the Soviet Union as the disintegration of historical Russia. He has claimed Russians and Ukrainians are one people and denied Ukraine its long history. On Sunday the Russian state media regulator Roskomnadzor instructed the press not to publish the interview with Ukraine\s leader and said an investigation has been started in order to identify the level of responsibility and what response will be taken in relation to those who carried out the interview. Roskomnadzor notes some of the media outlets that conducted the interview are designated foreign agents in Russia. The country recently passed new laws restricting the way in which Russian media can report on the war in Ukraine. The interview was published by outlets now based outside Russia. Ukraines military intelligence chief has accused Moscow of seeking to split Ukraine in two mirroring North and South Korea after Russia failed to take control of the whole country. But a senior adviser to President Zelensky Alexander Rodnyansky told the BBC that Ukraine would make no concessions on handing over territory to Russia. We\re certainly not willing to give up any territory or talk about our territorial integrity Mr Rodnyansky told BBC Radio 4\s World at One programme. If you ask the people who live in these areas they wouldn\t want to live in Russia. How can we leave them? Let alone the whole idea of slicing up our country. The possibility of Ukrainian neutrality is not new. Its been discussed by Russian and Ukrainian officials for at least two weeks. But President Zelenskys reference is perhaps the most explicit so far. Clearly theres no room for Nato membership in such a vision of Ukraines future. Removing that aspiration from Ukraines constitution (it was added in 2019) will need to be put to a referendum. With support for membership at an all-time high it will be a bitter pill for many Ukrainians to swallow. The key will be what sort of security guarantees can possibly take the place of being a member of the Western alliance. Ukrainian officials insist that guarantees will need to be much more specific than the 1994 Budapest Memorandum which gave Ukraine security assurances in return for giving up its stock of nuclear weapons. Ukraine will want to know the precise terms under which countries are prepared to come to its defence in the event of further Russian aggression. There are many versions of neutrality. Finding one that meets the competing needs of Kyiv and Moscow will not be simple. And what will Ukraines borders actually be? President Zelensky says Russian troops must retreat to positions held before Moscows full-scale invasion began on 24 February. He says Ukraine will not try and retake the Donbas or Crimea by force but Ukrainian officials are not yet ready simply to give up on territories that have been under Russian control (direct or indirect) since 2014.

Bill Sharpe 49 has been collecting donations at his family-run business in Radcliffe-on-Trent Nottinghamshire. Mr Sharpe and Ed will drive the ambulance from the UK to the countrys border with Poland on Friday. They will then hand it over to a local contact to take the much-needed transport and aid into Ukraine. Mr Sharpes company funded the purchase of the old ambulance that he and his 27-year-old son will take turns in driving across Europe. He said former NHS vehicles were usually decommissioned before being sold meaning the equipment and the emergency lights would have been removed. However he said he was able to organise for it to be kept in its original condition due to the nature of where it was going. He said: The main reason for doing this was getting ambulances over there for the soldiers. The contact that we\ve got over there in Ukraine said they were a desperate requirement. So we\re getting them over but filled with aid as well.

Mr Sharpe was also hoping to take a defibrillator if he can get one. That\s the kind of \holy grail\ thing that we\d love to be able to get hold of he said. Despite heading towards a war zone Mr Sharpe said he did not have any safety concerns. I\m worried mentally about what it\s going to be like at the other end. It\s obviously not a very nice environment with a lot of displaced unhappy people so I\m a bit apprehensive about that he said. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook Twitter or Instagram.

The Swiss timepieces were seized from a shop by security service agents on Tuesday for allegedly violating customs rules Swiss media report. It happened just days after Switzerland abandoned its traditional neutrality to join Western countries in imposing sanctions against Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. There is no Swiss confirmation. However the government has said Switzerland\s new luxury export ban has been causing uncertainties for some businesses. Watches from Audemars Piguet can cost more than £700000 ($921000) a piece. The company has not responded to a BBC request for comment. Russia hits back at sanctions with export bans Putin alters law on leased jets to defy sanctions According to Switzerlands NZZ am Sontag newspaper the watches were seized by agents working for Russias FSB security service from a Moscow subsidiary of Audemars Piguet. The agents apparently justified their raid by claiming the watches in question had violated local customs rules when they were being imported to Russia. After the invasion the luxury Swiss brand said it had ceased its operations in Russia and its website describes both of its two boutiques in the capital as temporarily closed. According to industry officials Switzerland exported 260 million Swiss francs ($280m) worth of watches to Russia last year but the market may be worth even more to the Swiss watch sector given the number of Russian customers buying luxury products in Switzerland. Russian officials have shown an increased willingness in the last few weeks to seize property from foreign companies trying to reduce their business dealings in Russia. Hundreds of leased foreign passenger jets worth almost $10bn remain grounded in the country with their owners having had their requests to return the airplanes denied. Earlier this month former President Dmitry Medvedev said that a new law would allow Russia to nationalise the assets of Western companies pulling out of the country.

That was the point I reached for the remote pressed pause and took a deep breath. The 2015 series has just starting airing here in America and for those of us who are new to it its a bit surreal. Every time you catch yourself chuckling you then start to feel sad. Its emotionally draining. I find I cant watch more than an episode at a time and I do so with a certain dread. Friends have told me they cant watch it at all. And its not because its bad. Its a good show and Zelensky is a talented actor. Hes charming and self-deprecating. No its hard to watch because we fear whats going to happen to the real President of Ukraine. There\s another scene in that same episode where the new president Vasyl Petrovych Holoborodko is introduced to his security detail body double. A smarmy political flunky turns from the double to Zelensky and says He\ll die from a sniper bullet for you then he laughs out loud at Zelensky\s look of horror. But the flunky chortles I think it won\t come to that. And then your stomach turns because right now it feels like the whole Western world is watching Ukraine and just praying that it wont indeed come to that.

But for the moment Zelensky and the brave people he leads are heroes in a world that has been short of them. Weve come out of a dark period of ugly political division and tragic medical crisis and we are longing for something good to believe in. Forty four million brave Ukrainians seem to have risen to the challenge and given us cause for hope in the power of the underdog. We root for them. We are amazed by their resilience. We long for them to survive and stay free. So its understandable that we may fall victim to what one analyst eloquently described as Western wishful thinking.

READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis After the invasion one US senator told me confidently that whatever happened the Ukrainian people would be free. It was the optimism Ive come to expect and appreciate from US politicians. And we hope it will be true. History reminds us however that good doesnt always prevail. Not against Russia anyway. Ask the Syrians still stuck under the boot of the Assad regime their cities destroyed by Russian bombs. Ask the Chechens who saw their capital flattened on the orders of Vladimir Putin. Or ask the countless brave Arabs Iranians Belarusians and Myanmarese who risked their lives to protest against oppressive rulers with little to show for it. In the suburbs of Ukraine that have become Putins latest battlefield David has indeed given Goliath an almighty shock. But make no mistake Russia is still a daunting adversary. One senior European diplomat who understands Putin is convinced that the Russian president has no interest in negotiating any settlement. Rather he thinks Putin is using this moment to regroup and resupply ready for another potentially more devastating assault. Were hopeful Westerners at risk of underestimating Russias military chances I asked? Yes he nodded. Image caption Ukraine campaign map on 24 March Russias military boasts 900000 active duty troops and two million reservists - more than eight times that of Ukraine. It still has a massive arsenal and a satellite state in Belarus from which it can draw more troops as well as the ability to recruit mercenaries from countries like Georgia or Syria. It has cyber warfare capabilities it has not yet fully unleashed. It has 4500 nuclear weapons it has threatened to use and chemical weapons that the West has warned it might. The Russians have performed much worse than anyone expected but they have made some territorial gains making slow but steady progress around Mariupol and threatening to cut off Ukrainian forces near the breakaway eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Often this progress has come by flattening civilian neighbourhoods. Ignoring or diminishing those gains or the remaining power of the Russian military wont help Ukraine. Indeed it could hurt it. The Ukrainians success depends on two things their own phenomenal courage and just as critical the steady supply of military hardware that its getting from Western countries. If those countries or the public in those countries start for a moment to think David has beaten Goliath then the flow of weapons could slow or stop. That would be catastrophic for the Ukrainian resistance. President Biden has spent this week in Europe shoring up the Western alliance. But theres a growing recognition this fight will go on for longer than either Russia or the West anticipated. The Ukrainians may need arms supplies for months to come. The alliance will need to keep its resolve in order to match Putins determination. This is no time to be unrealistic. Wide-eyed realism will help Zelensky more than wishful thinking.]War in Ukraine: Change of emphasis or admission of failure by Moscow?,"Moscow now says the main aim is to ""liberate"" eastern Ukraine - a change of emphasis or more?",War in Ukraine: Change of emphasis or admission of failure by Moscow? By Paul Adams BBC News Published 25 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Kharkiv has been pounded for weeks - now that Russian firepower may be deployed further east Is the Russian military having to change its plans? Perhaps even reduce the scale of Moscows ambitions in Ukraine? Its probably too early to tell but theres definitely a shift in emphasis. A top Russian general - Sergey Rudskoy - says the first stage of what President Vladimir Putin calls Russia\s special military operation has been mostly accomplished and that Russian forces will now concentrate on the complete liberation of the Donbas. This is likely to mean a more concerted effort to push beyond the line of contact that separates Ukrainian government-held territory in the east of the country from the Russian-backed separatist people\s republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. The pace of Russias advance in other areas of Ukraine remains glacial. Its forces have been pushed back from positions around the capital Kyiv and are said to have started digging defensive positions to avoid losing more or prepare for some kind of pause. Next stop Kyiv - the battle on the capitals outskirts Defiant troops tell Russians: Go home while youre still alive Its probably way too early to conclude that Russia has given up on capturing Kyiv but Western officials say that Russia continues to experience setback after setback. On Friday they said Russia had lost another general - the seventh - and that morale was at rock bottom in some units. They believe General Rudskoys announcement implies that Moscow knows that its ambitious pre-war strategy has failed. Russia is recognising that it can\t pursue its operations on multiple axes simultaneously one official said. As many as 10 new Russian battalion tactical groups are being generated officials say and are heading for the Donbas. Even before the war began last month they voiced the fear that Russia would make a concerted effort to encircle and envelop Ukraines best fighting units which make up the Joint Forces Operation (JFO) stationed along the line of contact. Retreat may not mean tame ambitions A renewed push now could see Russian troops pushing out into so-far unconquered areas of Donetsk and Luhansk possibly aiming to link up with forces moving south from Kharkiv and Izyum. And if Russia can succeed in finally pacifying the port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov then other forces could move north and complete the encirclement of the JFO. Some of these objectives still seem out of reach. Mariupols defenders are putting up a ferocious fight preventing Russia from fully achieving another of its pre-war ambitions - a land bridge from the Crimean Peninsula to the Donbas. But if Moscow has concluded that it makes more sense to concentrate for the time being on achieving one objective at a time its likely to concentrate its firepower especially from the air. The Ukrainian military disciplined and motivated as it is will need all the help it can get to withstand the pressure. I hope that\s where the Western supply of arms will make a significant contribution to Ukrainian forces one Western official said. If the coming days do see a shift of focus to the Donbas that doesnt yet mean that Moscow has abandoned its wider ambitions. We don\t see a re-evaluation of the invasion as a whole a senior US defence official said.

Suella Braverman said Sir Howard Morrison would become an independent adviser to Ukraines chief prosecutor Iryna Venediktova. Sir Howard served as a judge on the International Criminal Court in The Hague for more than 12 years. It comes as Russian forces continue to be accused of violating international law by targeting civilians. Could Putin be prosecuted for war crimes? Are Russias attacks war crimes? Earlier this month Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of committing war crimes after it launched air strikes in Kharkiv that hit an opera house a concert hall and government offices. The ICCs chief prosecutor later said evidence was being collected on whether the Russian military had committed war crimes crimes against humanity and genocide. But Russia is not a member of the ICC so any Russian nationals indicted by the court would have to be extradited by the Kremlin. Asked by MPs in the House of Commons on Thursday about alternative ways of prosecuting war criminals other than the ICC the attorney general said all options are on the table although she insisted the ICC was the UK\s preferred option. I will always defer and support my counterpart in Ukraine the prosecutor general in terms of my efforts to support her in terms of her choice of route for redress she said. But whilst we welcome the focus on accountability we do believe that the ICC is the right place for those responsible for committing these atrocious crimes in Ukraine to be held accountable for their actions. Announcing Sir Howard\s appointment Ms Braverman said the UK was committed to showing that the atrocities we see being committed day after day in Ukraine will not be forgotten. Ms Venediktova welcomed Sir Howard\s help saying his experience and knowledge of international criminal law speaks louder than words. During his time as a judge Sir Howard oversaw cases such as that of the Serbian war criminal Radovan Karadzic. The attorney generals office said Ms Braverman was in regular communication with Ukraines prosecutor general and they planned to meet in person next month. On a trip to The Hague last week Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab accused Mr Putin of responding in ever more barbaric ways in Ukraine and offered the ICC financial and technical help for prosecuting alleged war crimes in the country. Boris Johnson has used similar language describing the Russian military under Mr Putin\s orders of using barbaric and indiscriminate tactics. Russia denies targeting civilians and says it is carrying out a military operation against neo-Nazis in Ukraine.

Russian activists and journalists speaking out against their country\s so-called special military operation in Ukraine have had their homes vandalised by unknown pro-Kremlin figures. Apartment doors have been daubed with threatening graffiti labelling the people inside a traitor with messages featuring the letter Z - a pro-Kremlin symbol of Russia\s war in Ukraine. Other examples are even more extreme. In one case a leading Russian journalist discovered a pigs head wearing a wig on his doorstep with an anti-Semitic sticker stuck to his door. Alexei Venediktov the long-time editor of radio station Ekho of Moscow before it stopped broadcasting due to increased Russian censorship posted photos of the vandalism pointing out the irony of an anti-Semitic attack happening in the country that defeated fascism. Such vandalism is a sign of the increasingly intimidating atmosphere in Russia for those people who publicly express their opposition to the war in Ukraine. Manure on the doorstep When Darya Kheikinen looked through the peephole on the door of her St Petersburg apartment she noticed it had been painted red on the outside. She guessed straight away what had happened - there had been similar instances with other activists. She opened the door to find the word traitor scrawled in large red letters across the outside several pieces of paper with messages such as a traitor to the motherland lives here pinned to her home and a pile of manure on the mat at her feet. IMAGE SOURCE DARYA KHEIKINEN Image caption Darya Kheikinen found a pile of manure on her doorstep two days in a row It probably happened because of my public anti-war statements and opposition views Ms Kheikinen a well-known political activist told the BBC adding that the same thing happened to three other St Petersburg activists at the same time. It happened again the next morning - but only to her this time. The door was covered in green dye and there was spray foam in the lock. There were signs reading \we will not forgive Nazism\ and \a Finnish Nazi lives here\ she said pointing out that her surname is Finnish. The messages reflect the Kremlin\s false claims that Ukraine\s government is run by Nazis and its operation in Ukraine is necessary to denazify the country. Ms Kheikinen doesnt know who was responsible for the attack but said as far as she knows the only people who have her address are her parents and the police. I can\t say that it has scared me she said. Actually I find it amusing. Imagine some idiot dragging a bag of manure up the stairs to the 11th floor - and doing it two nights in a row! Scum and traitors Since Russia\s war in Ukraine began life for those who oppose it has become increasingly difficult. The government passed a law threatening people who spread fake information about the war with 15 years in prison. Vladimir Putin and other politicians have painted any opposition to the war as a betrayal of the country. Any people and especially the Russian people will always be able to distinguish the true patriots from the scum and the traitors and just spit them out like a fly that accidentally flew into their mouth the president said in a speech on 16 March. He went on to claim that the West is trying to destroy Russia by using fifth columnists - meaning enemies within - to provoke civil confrontation. IMAGE SOURCE DMITRY IVANOV Image caption Don\t betray the motherland Dima warns a message on Dmitry Ivanov\s door Just a few hours after that speech student activist Dmitry Ivanov whose anti-war opinions are a major feature of his Telegram channel with nearly 10000 followers received a call from his mother asking if he had seen the graffiti all over the door to their landing. It said \don\t betray the motherland Dima\ he told the BBC. There were also three large Zs making it clear the message related to Russia\s actions in Ukraine. The neighbours probably weren\t that surprised he said explaining that his political opinions are no secret because the police turn up at his door every now and then to warn him against attending protests. The doors of three other activists and journalists in Moscow were also vandalised that evening. But Mr Ivanov whose activism began by reporting on a protest against a noisy fan-zone directly outside his university during the 2018 football World Cup in Russia said the attack hasnt put him off. The actions of the police frighten me much more. They have the resources and power to ruin people\s lives but this - this is just minor hooliganism. He decided not to report the vandalism to the police because he didnt want to end up on the wrong side of them he said. Incidents like these might be minor but they are the product of a political environment where you either support the war or are labelled a traitor. The consequences for those who oppose Russias actions in Ukraine are wide-ranging and can include losing your job or even criminal prosecution.

He said Russian President Vladimir Putin would try to impose a demarcation line separating the eastern and southern regions from the rest of Ukraine since he would not be able to absorb the whole country. Gen Budanov predicted this quasi-state would be unviable given the resistance of the local population. He said that what he described as a total Ukrainian guerrilla safari was about to open. The generals warning came amid continued reaction to US President Joe Bidens speech in Poland on Saturday in which he said that Mr Putin should not be allowed to remain in power. Media caption Joe Bidens speech on Saturday has had continuing repercussions Mr Bidens Secretary of State Antony Blinken denied that the US had any plans to bring about regime change in Russia or anywhere else. And French President Emmanuel Macron warned against the verbal escalation of the war in Ukraine saying this would make it impossible to bring about a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops. But this isnt the first time President Biden has veered off-script and thrown a live grenade into an otherwise well-prepared measured speech. Is that a strength - saying what many of his citizens are thinking - or a weakness? Our North America reporter Anthony Zurcher takes a look at President Bidens habit of going off-book.

Ukraine rejects breakaway referendum plan Ukraine has described plans by the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peoples Republic to hold a referendum on joining Russia as having no legal basis. Ukraines foreign ministry spokesman said any referendum would be fake and warned that Moscow would face further isolation if it went ahead. Earlier the leader of Luhansk said a vote could happen soon and that the population would vote overwhelmingly to leave Ukraine and join Russia. He later rowed back on that statement Tass reports to clarify that he had only been stating a personal opinion - and that no preparations were actually being made for such a vote. Last month Russia formally recognised the Luhansk and Donetsk breakaway republics as independent states paving the way for Russian troops invasion of Ukraine.

The 26-year-old was one of the more than 18000 Indian students studying medicine in Ukraine who were evacuated after the war began. Mr Kumar was in a medical school in Uzhhorod for the past six years and would have qualified as a doctor in three months. Mr Kumar now stares at an uncertain future - he is unable to continue his studies or find a place in Indian colleges. The dream of becoming a doctor for thousands of young Indians begins from small towns and villages. But aspirants have always far outnumbered the vacancies available at affordable government-run colleges. Private medical colleges are accessible to only those who can afford very high fees. In 2021 over 1.5 million students appeared for qualifying exams to government colleges but less than 6% managed to get admission. According to Public Health Foundation of India a think tank only one out of every 11 candidates in 2014 got into medical colleges. Last year the number had increased to one out of every 19 candidates. Dismal results So you have an increase in the number of people wanting to be admitted but the seats have not risen proportionately. As a result a large number of students look for outside avenues says president of the foundation K Srinath Reddy. A farmers son Mr Kumar was studying to be the first doctor not just in the family but in his entire village. Since he could not get admission in a government college heading to Ukraine was the next affordable option. I would have had to pay nearly $150000 (£113000) in a private Indian medical college but in Ukraine it cost me around $30000 for the entire six-year course. Still] I took a huge loan and my father had to sell some of our ancestral land to fund my studies] Mr Kumar said. For medical students with a foreign degree there is one final hurdle - clearing a qualifying exam to practice in India. The percentage of success in these exams have been fairly dismal says Dr Reddy. Between 2015 and 2018 the pass percentage was only 19%. In 2019 it went up to 25% but it came down to 16% in 2020. IMAGE SOURCE SWATI SAGARIKA SABAT Image caption Swati Sagarika Sabat has been attending online classes organised by her university on her phone He said the teaching system abroad didn\t adequately prepare students to Indian medical practices. Now as students return from Ukraine leaving their studies mid-way there is uncertainty. I worry without a degree I can\t take the qualifying examination in India. How do I even fill out my application if I don\t have a degree? Mr Kumar laments. Its a reality that 22-year old medical student Swati Sagarika Sabat is still coming to terms with. Shes back home in Kendrapara city in the eastern state of Odisha struggling to learn medicine over a Zoom class her university in Ukraine has organised. We are not sitting with our teachers or seeing patients. How can anyone learn how to perform a surgery online? We can\t learn without getting any practical experience says Ms Sabat. Shortage of doctors Some feel the government should allow the students from Ukraine to be accommodated in local medical colleges. The government has said it is looking into their matter. But what is essential is improving the existing infrastructure in India so that students have more choices in the country instead of having to go abroad. In the last seven years the number of medical seats in Indian colleges has gone up from around 52000 to nearly 89000. This is a substantial rise but still not enough. With one doctor for every 1500 people India desperately need more medical professionals The government is looking to set up hospitals in districts especially in rural areas. The upgraded district hospitals will have medical colleges attached to them. By using district hospitals as a training area you are actually also creating a cultural shift. You are making them much more responsive to the needs of the community says Dr Reddy.

Published 25 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Leaders of the Nato military alliance have approved major increases of forces in Eastern Europe. They also said that any use of chemical or biological weapons by Russia would result in severe consequences. What is Nato? Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - is a military alliance formed in 1949 by 12 countries including the US Canada the UK and France. Its aim was originally to counter the threat of post-war Russian expansion in Europe. Soviet Russia responded by creating its own military alliance of eastern European communist countries called the Warsaw Pact. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 a number of former Warsaw Pact countries switched sides and joined Nato. The alliance now has 30 members. Members agree to come to one anothers aid in the event of an armed attack against any individual member state. Why isnt Nato sending troops to Ukraine? Because Ukraine isnt a Nato member the alliance isnt obliged to come to the countrys defence. And Nato countries fear that if their troops confront Russian forces in Ukraine it could lead to an all-out conflict between Russia and the West. Nato says its members are determined to do all we can to support Ukraine but must ensure the war doesn\t escalate beyond its borders. This is why Nato rejected imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine. However it has approved sending four new battlegroups to Slovakia Hungary Bulgaria and Romania - three of which border Ukraine - doubling Natos presence in the region. Western leaders meet to discuss Ukraine support UK troops will not fight against Russia - Wallace Why isnt Ukraine a Nato member? Nato offered Ukraine a path towards membership in 2008. After Russias annexation of Crimea in 2014 Ukraine made joining a priority. But this hasnt happened mainly because of Russias long-standing opposition. One of Russias demands before the invasion was that Ukraine should never be allowed to join - something the alliance refused to support. Russia fears Nato is encroaching on its territory by taking on new members from eastern Europe and that admitting Ukraine would bring its forces into its backyard. Ukraine\s President Zelensky has accepted his country can\t join Nato at present saying: It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of Nato. We understand this. China joins Russia in opposing Nato expansion Which weapons have the UK and other countries sent to Ukraine? Ahead of the Nato meeting in Brussels the UK said it would provide 6000 new defensive missiles and £25m to help Ukraine pay its armed forces. The UK has already supplied more than 4000 shoulder-mounted NLAW anti-tank missiles as well as a small number of Javelin missiles. It has also sent some Starstreak missiles. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption A Ukrainian soldier holding a Javelin anti-tank missile system during exercises in 2021 It has also given body armour helmets and boots. In addition the UK has deployed Sky Sabre a long-range air defence system to Poland along with 100 military personnel to operate it. The US initially sent $200m (£152m) and then a further $350m (£267m) of weapons. This included Javelin missiles Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and body armour. The US has since announced a $1bn (£760m) security aid package. This includes more sophisticated longer-range weapons and drones. It has also allowed other Nato countries to supply Ukraine with US-made weapons. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Nato has stepped up its military defences in eastern Europe The EU has said it will spend up to 450m euros (£376m) to fund the supply of weapons to Ukraine. It is the first time in its history that the EU has helped provide arms for a warzone. Germany too has dropped its long-standing restrictions on supplying weapons to a combat area. The Netherlands Belgium Poland Estonia Latvia the Czech Republic and Slovakia have also sent military equipment including ammunition fuel and rations. Are arms shipments to Ukraine making a difference? How many troops does Nato have in Eastern Europe? Even before the latest deployments are agreed Nato already had troops stretching from the Baltic republics in the north to Romania in the south. They were stationed there in 2014 after Russia\s annexation of Crimea and are designed to act as a tripwire in case of a Russian attack. Nato has sent elements of its 40000-strong Response Force to Eastern European countries bordering Russia and Ukraine. It has 100 fighter jets on high alert and 120 ships including three carrier groups patrolling the seas from the far north to the eastern Mediterranean. The US has committed to sending more troops to Europe - they will join the four multinational battlegroups Nato has in Estonia Latvia Lithuania and Poland and its multinational brigade in Romania.]Ukraine war: The drone pilots monitoring Russian troops,On patrol with a Ukrainian defence unit carrying out aerial reconnaissance around Kyiv.,]Global Questions: Ukraine Crisis: What Next for Europe?,Global Questions examines the prospects for a peaceful solution to the war in Ukraine.,UnknownJeremy Vine: Ukraine and Bitterns,"Jeremy discusses one month of the Ukraine war, single people, Parkinson's and bitterns.",UnknownUkraine: How Did We Get Here?,Edward Stourton and a panel of guests explain the steps that led to the current conflict.,UnknownGoodbye Home: Ukraine's Border Heartbreak,Stephanie Hegarty finds relief and heartbreak in equal measure at Ukraine's border.,Unknown"Ukraine's Oligarch Election: The Comedian, The 'Clone' and the Chocolate King",Jonah Fisher reports from Kiev ahead of Ukraine's presidential election.,UnknownUkraine's Forgotten Children,What a lifetime in the care of the state really means for Ukraine's abandoned children.,Unknown"Ukraine not alone in fight against Russia, says Boris Johnson","Boris Johnson warns if Vladimir Putin uses chemical weapons in Ukraine the consequences will be ""catastrophic for him"".",Ukraine not alone in fight against Russia says Boris Johnson Published 25 March comments Comments Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EPA Ukraine is not alone in its fight against Russia\s invasion Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He said the UK would not stand by while Vladimir Putin vents his fury on Ukraine and would work to ramp up defensive weaponry for the country. Speaking in Brussels he warned that if the Russian president used chemical weapons the consequences would be catastrophic for him. Earlier the UK announced sanctions on 65 more Russian groups and individuals. Mr Johnson later told BBC Newsnight that Russia did not want peace and instead wanted to intensify its attack on Ukraine. Leaders from Nato the EU and the G7 have been holding emergency meetings in Brussels to discuss the conflict. Speaking at a news conference following the Nato summit Mr Johnson defended the level of the UKs support for Ukraine saying the government planned to send 6000 more missiles to the country as well as an extra £25m in aid to help Ukraine pay the salaries of its armed forces. The PM said kit would be provided to Ukraine to defend against its bullying neighbour. Mr Johnson also promised a new deployment of UK troops to Bulgaria on top of doubling troops both in Poland and in Estonia. It follows Natos earlier announcement that new battle groups would be created in Bulgaria Hungary Romania and Slovakia. The message Putin can take is: Ukraine is not alone. We stand with the people of Kyiv Mariupol Lviv and Donetsk Mr Johnson said. As President Zelensky himself has said the people of Ukraine must prevail and Putin must fail - and he will. Lets hit Putins gold says PM amid new sanctions Defiant troops to Russians: Go home while youre alive Western leaders meet to discuss Ukraine support Mr Johnson added that Western nations were looking to steadily ratchet up the amount of military gear they are sending Ukraine but that it was proving difficult to meet the country\s request for warplanes and tanks. In a virtual appearance at the summit earlier Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\s asked Nato for 1% of all your planes 1% of all your tanks. Mr Johnson said: What President Zelensky wants is to try to relieve Mariupol and to help the thousands of Ukrainian fighters in the city. To that end he does need armour as he sees it. We are looking at what we can do to help. But logistically it looks very difficult both with armour and with jets. Mr Johnson added that no Western power was looking to put boots on the ground or impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. He acknowledged that the Ukrainian president wanted more from Nato saying allies felt agony about their inability to do more given the constraints we face. In a statement reported by Russias Ria news agency Russias foreign ministry said Natos decision to continue supporting Ukraine showed the military alliance wanted the conflict to continue. Media caption Watch: Zelensky calls on people to support freedom one month after Russia invaded Ukraine The UK government has already given £400m in humanitarian and economic aid to Ukraine and its neighbouring nations since Russias invasion last month. The PM said ministers had sanctioned more than 1000 Russian individuals and entities so far in the toughest sanctions the UK had ever imposed. The Wagner Group a private military firm thought to function as an arms-length unit of the Russian military was among the 65 entities hit by the latest sanctions announced by the UK earlier. Also targeted were Gazprombank the countrys third-largest bank and one of the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas and the state-run shipping firm Sovcomflot. The stepdaughter of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov Polina Kovaleva who is thought to own a London property worth an estimated £4m was also targeted by the measures. Earlier Mr Johnson called on the West to consider measures to prevent Russia using its gold reserves to prop up its currency the rouble. He told the news conference the Kremlin was trying to get around the sanctions on their gold and the UK and others were trying to ensure there was no leakage or no sale of bullion into markets around the world.

He said that while one could be sympathetic to ordinary Russians the way Mr Putin was leading Russia was utterly catastrophic and his invasion of Ukraine was inhuman and barbaric. Mr Johnson dismissed talk about the use of nuclear weapons as a distraction from what was happening in Ukraine - where he said Russia\s use of conventional weapons against innocent people had been absolutely barbaric. He warned that any use of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine by Russia would be disastrous for Putin. There is a visceral horror of the use of these weapons of mass destruction. I think that if Putin were to engage in anything like that the consequences would be very very severe. You have to have a bit of ambiguity about your response but I think it would be catastrophic for him if he were to do that. And I think that he understands that. Media caption Watch what Boris Johnson says about the prospect of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine In an interview with the BBCs Newsnight Mr Johnson said Ukraine can win the war with Russia - not necessarily on the battlefield but by making an occupation impossible. There\s a sense in which Putin has already failed or lost because I think that he had literally no idea that the Ukrainians were going to mount the resistance that they are and he totally misunderstood what Ukraine is - and far from extinguishing Ukraine as a nation he\s solidified it... He can\t subjugate Ukraine. The prime minister added that he was not optimistic the Russian president truly wanted peace and that he had instead decided to double down in his assault on Ukraine which he said was a tragic mistake. Mr Johnson sparked anger at the weekend after appearing to make a comparison between Britons voting to leave the European Union and Ukrainians fighting for the freedom from Russia. But when asked about this the prime minister said that had not been the analogy he was making and his words had been wildly misconstrued. Elsewhere US President Joe Biden warned any use of chemical weapons by Mr Putin would be met with a response in kind the nature of which would depend on the nature of the use. Mr Biden said the Russian President had miscalculated in his decision to invade Ukraine and had banked on Nato being split. Nato has never never been more united. Putin is getting exactly the opposite of (what) he intended to have as a consequence of going into Ukraine.

Mr Blinkens comments come a day after President Joe Biden said his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin should not be allowed to remain in power. Mr Biden made the unscripted remark at the end of a speech in Poland. Mr Blinken said the president simply made the point that Mr Putin could not be allowed to wage war against Ukraine. The Kremlin dismissed Mr Bidens remark saying it was for Russians to choose their leader. I think the president the White House made the point last night that quite simply President Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else Mr Blinken said on Sunday during a visit to Israel. As you know and as you have heard us say repeatedly we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia or anywhere else for that matter. In this case as in any case it\s up to the people of the country in question it\s up to the Russian people he added. Media caption Watch: Joe Biden closes speech in Poland by saying Vladimir Putin cannot remain in power For God\s sake this man cannot remain in power US President Joe Biden said about his Russian counterpart President Vladimir Putin during a speech in Poland\s capital Warsaw on Saturday. This was quickly followed by the White House saying Mr Biden wasnt calling for regime change but was instead making a point about Mr Putin not being allowed to exercise power over his neighbours. This was clearly an attempt at rolling back - the concern is that this is going to put more pressure on Putin and make him more uneasy. Given that he is the head of a country that is struggling militarily and is in control of a nuclear arsenal the concern on the Americans part is that they dont want to back Mr Putin into a corner. Calling out for regime change directly could cause instability and increase unpredictability. And the last thing you want in these circumstances is unpredictability. Mr Bidens comment prompted strong criticism from veteran US diplomat Richard Haass. The comments made a difficult situation more difficult and a dangerous situation more dangerous tweeted Mr Haass who is president of the US Council on Foreign Relations. That is obvious he added. Less obvious is how to undo the damage but I suggest his chief aides reach their counterparts & make clear the US is prepared to deal with this Russian government. Mr Haass returned to the subject after the White House qualified President Biden\s remarks saying: The White House walk back of @POTUS regime change call is unlikely to wash. Putin will see it as confirmation of what he\s believed all along. Bad lapse in discipline that runs risk of extending the scope and duration of the war.

The US Japan and Australia - the three other members of this coalition formed to counter China\s influence - have been extremely strong in terms of dealing with Putin\s aggression he said. India however has doggedly pursued a non-aligned foreign policy since independence where according to the first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru we will stay away from the big blocs…to be friendly to all countries…not join any alliance. But will the war in Ukraine now put Indias fabled neutrality under strain? Uncharted territory India is feeling the heat no doubt about it Michael Kugelman deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center a Washington-based think tank says. Fence-sitting is a bigger diplomatic gamble now than in the past given that Russia\s invasion of Ukraine is one of the worst aggressions in decades and India\s relations with the West have never been stronger. India has abstained from voting in the United Nations - three times in a week - on resolutions condemning Russia. There have been reports of a surge of Indian imports of discounted Russian oil as energy prices spiked in the wake of the war. And it has pointedly stopped short of criticising Russia which it has called a longstanding and time-tested friend in the past. The two countries share a decades-old relationship harking back to the Cold War and Russia is also Indias biggest defence supplier. The US is now trying to persuade India that things have changed. For one the relationship between the two countries has deepened - bilateral trade between India and the US is $150bn compared to $8bn between India and Russia. US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland visited Delhi this week and had in her own words broad and deep conversations with Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and senior officials. She acknowledged the historical relationship between India and Russia but said times have changed now and there was an evolution of thinking in India. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption PM Modi with President Putin in 2021 - India and Russia have a historical relationship Ms Nuland told journalists that the US and Europe were willing to be strong defence and security partners of India. She said US could help wean India off its dependence on Russian defence supplies. The war was a major inflection point in the autocratic-democratic struggle in which India\s support was needed she noted. Such an explicit message from the US Mr Kugelman says may well be uncharted territory. But Indian experts are loathe to believe that the country is under diplomatic pressure. Why India is not criticising Russia over Ukraine They point to the fact that other Quad members have been sympathetic to India and that the US itself had acknowledged India\s humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. If there\s one country which is isolated in the Quad it\s not India it\s the US says former Indian diplomat Jitendra Nath Misra. And weakening a strategic partner through sanctions - for buying Russian arms or oil - doesnt benefit the US which wants India to play counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific. Strategically neutral At the same time Indias close ties with Russia do not mean that it has been aloof to the crisis in Ukraine experts say. They point to the joint statement issued last week by Mr Modi and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida during the latter\s visit to Delhi: the two leaders expressed their serious concern about the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. They also emphasised that the contemporary global order has been built on the UN Charter international law and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of states. Mr Modi has spoken to both President Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urging them to end the violence. His government managed to get more than 22000 Indians out of Ukraine in 90 evacuation flights. IMAGE SOURCE AFP Image caption Russia is supplying equipment like the S-400 missile defence system to India Former diplomat Anil Triguniyat who served in Moscow says President Biden\s remark that India\s response was shaky was possibly a joke of some kind. India\s position has been consistent and principled all through. India has stood for diplomacy dialogue respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine he says. We have to be strategically neutral. There\s no other way. Happymon Jacob a professor of foreign policy at Delhi\s Jawaharlal Nehru University believes that the heat hasn\t really increased on India and it is managing the contradictions quite well. The question is whether India could have done more he says. Can India do more? The jury is out on this. Although India had managed the crisis admirably it should have called a spade a spade… It is an invasion it is a war India\s former foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon told The Wire. It affects your credibility if you don\t he added. But Delhi\s special relationship with Moscow - fraught with nostalgia and deep trust as Mr Kugelman describes it - means that it won\t easily turn against its ally. These sentiments die hard even after Russia has launched a massive cold-blooded invasion. But at the same time India doesn\t want to alienate its ties with the West. One way to avoid alienation say experts is for India to offer itself as a third-party mediator - something which Ukraines Ambassador to India Igor Polikha had urged at the beginning of the war. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption India has provided humanitarian aid - medicines medical equipment relief material - to Ukraine India can leverage its deep ties to Moscow and cordial relations with Kyiv and try to push both sides to de-escalate Mr Kugelman says. To be sure Putin might be undeterrable. But if Delhi is at least making an effort to bring about de-escalation that should pre-empt potential tensions with the West over India\s refusal to take the West\s side. Mr Jacob echoes the sentiment saying when Ukrainians asked for mediation India could have taken up the offer. India still has the opportunity. It should still go ahead and offer itself as a neutral mediator. After all India needs both US and Russia on its side to help manage its fraught relationship with China. Last year the two neighbours faced off against each other along their disputed border in the Himalayan region. In the long term Mr Triguniyat says India should pursue a policy of strategic autonomy - not far removed from non-alignment -and initiate a grouping of nations for strategic unity to serve their development interests in a much more severe Cold War 2.0 that is likely to emerge after the war in Ukraine. Former Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran has said the nightmare scenario for India would be if the US comes to the conclusion that it confronts a greater threat from Russia and that this justifies a strategic accommodation with China. Bluntly this means concede Chinese dominance in Asia while safeguarding its European flank. That\s a nightmare India will never get used to.

After months of intense rehabilitation she was told she would probably never be able to run again. Five years on and she was running in her friends memory. I don\t like being told I can\t do something she said. I was told… \don\t think about it - you\re going to have arthritic knees - just don\t go down it. It won\t be good for you\.

I\d been in this accident. My legs didn\t work like they should. Even to stand up for the first time I felt so heavy. My legs had no weight through them for months. So much of it is mental. You\ve just got to learn to trust your body and so going from nothing to walking was hard enough. Getting into the running was just trial and error. Putting one foot in front of the other and we\ll see what happens.

Her life finished at 26 and I think about all these things that I want to do with my life - and I can she said. I know she\d be thinking I was crazy.

Boris Johnsons comments came as the UK announced sanctions on 65 more groups and individuals including a private military firm and a major Russian bank. Speaking ahead of a Nato summit the PM said the UK and the West must tighten the economic vice on Vladimir Putin. He said Russia crossed red lines by targeting Ukrainian civilians and tough steps now could help shorten the war. In addition to the new raft of financial sanctions the UK government has announced plans to send 6000 more missiles to Ukraine. Leaders from Nato the EU and the G7 are holding emergency meetings in Brussels to discuss the ongoing situation in Ukraine. On Thursday Nato announced the creation of new battle groups in Bulgaria Hungary Romania and Slovakia while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky used a virtual address to urge the bloc to increase its supply of military equipment. Ahead of the talks Mr Johnson said that by deliberately bombing civilian centres Putin had already crossed the red line into barbarism. We\ve got to step up. We\ve got to increase our support he said. We\ve got to tighten the economic vice around Putin sanctioning more people today as we are sanctioning the Wagner Group looking at what we can do to stop Putin using his gold reserves. In an interview with LBC he added: We need to do more economically. Can we do more to stop him Putin] using his gold reserves for instance in addition to his cash reserves? The more pressure we apply now particularly on things like gold I believe the more we can shorten the war … And then we need to do more to give the Ukrainians military support. As Mr Putin invaded Ukraine the Russian Central Bank deployed some of its $640bn war chest of currency and gold reserves to prop up the Russian rouble.

Also targeted were Gazprombank the countrys third-largest bank and one of the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas and the state-run shipping firm Sovcomflot. The reported step-daughter of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov Polina Kovaleva who is thought to own a London property worth an estimated £4million was also targeted by the measures. Western leaders meet to discuss Ukraine support Zelensky calls on people to protest to support freedom In his speech to Nato leaders Mr Zelensky called on them to give or sell Ukraine more tanks and anti-aircraft defence systems. I don\t want to blame Nato. I understand this is not you he said. These are not your missiles or bombs which are destroying our cities. I simply want you to know the alliance still can prevent Ukrainian deaths… by providing us all the munitions we are asking for. The summit follows an announcement by the UK government that it would be providing Ukraine with an additional 6000 anti-tank and other missiles. The UK has already sent 4000 anti-tank weapons but will now send another 3000 plus a similar number of what Downing Street described as high explosive missiles. The prime minister is also expected to set out plans to offer more help to Ukraine with intelligence and longer-range combat. Ukrainian officials indicated this week the countrys armed forces had the equipment they needed to stop tanks at short range but needed more that would help them do the same over longer distances. The UK will also send an additional £25m in aid to help Ukraine pay the salaries of its armed forces. The government has already given £400m in humanitarian and economic aid to Ukraine and neighbouring nations since Russias invasion.

Liz Truss told the Sunday Telegraph that Moscow would also have to commit to no further aggression or face the prospect of them being reimposed. The West had to remain tough to get peace she said. The UK US and EU have so far imposed sanctions on over 1000 Russian individuals and businesses. This week saw Moscow announce it would be refocusing its military operations in Ukraine to the countrys east. The move was interpreted by many as a sign that the Kremlin was looking to scale back an invasion that has so far made significantly less progress than was widely expected. Ms Truss said that a negotiations unit had been set up to assist Ukraine once the Russians were serious about negotiations but added: I don\t believe they are serious at present. That\s why... we need to double down on sanctions she said. The foreign secretary has previously said she believes the peace talks are a smokescreen designed to distract from Russia\s actions and allow its armed forces time to regroup.

The jets estimated to be worth $60m (£45m) were seized at Farnborough and Biggin Hill airports following a three-week investigation. Ms Truss said she believed more should have been done to deter Mr Putin following his annexation of Crimea in 2014. So there needs to be hard levers she said. Of course sanctions are a hard lever. Those sanctions should only come off with a full ceasefire and withdrawal but also commitments that there will be no further aggression. She added that snapback sanctions could be used in the event of more aggression in the future. IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption Eugene Shvidler (right) has been sanctioned over his ties with longstanding business partner Roman Abramovich As well as sanctions on individuals recent weeks have seen dozens of countries impose bans on the export of luxury goods to Russia and close their airspace to Russian airlines. Some Russian banks have also been banned from using Swift the system used to manage international payments and efforts are underway to explore how Europe can reduce its dependency on Russian oil and gas. Ms Truss\s comments echo those of US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken who said this month that the sanctions on Russia were not designed to be permanent. Mr Blinken said the sanctions could go away in the event of an irreversible withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. However speaking in Poland on Saturday President Biden said that while sanctions were weakening Russia the West needed to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead. Asked about ongoing disagreements with the EU about the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol which sets out the post-Brexit trading arrangements between Northern Ireland and the EU Ms Truss said that countries would always have differences that we need to resolve. But those types of differences between friends and allies are different from the scale and the sheer belligerence and aggression and lying of Russia she said. She added that given the scale of their differences with Russia it was vital that Western countries stick together.

In Warsaw he met Ukraines defence and foreign ministers Oleksii Reznikov and Dmytro Kuleba. Some say the fact the ministers left Ukraine for the talks is a sign of growing confidence in how the war with Russia is going. Mr Kuleba said they had received additional pledges from the US president on developing defence co-operation. Mr Biden said stability in Europe was critically important to US interests and that whenever Washington had stayed out of crises in Europe it had come back to bite the country. But the US president also made some fiery comments on Saturday. Meeting Ukrainian refugees in Poland Mr Biden called the Russian president a butcher - something unlikely to help strained US-Russia relations. Then later in a speech in front of Warsaw\s historic royal castle he addressed the Russian people telling them: For God\s sake this man cannot remain in power. That led to a stern message from the Kremlin that the president of Russia is elected by Russians - and not the US president. Separately a White House spokesperson told the media that Mr Biden was not calling for regime change with the remark - merely making a point about Mr Putin\s attempt to exercise power over other countries. In Ukraine itself officials said three powerful explosions had rocked the western city of Lviv. Thick black smoke was seen rising over the outskirts of the city. The cause of the blasts is not known but city officials warned residents to remain indoors. Saboteurs or spectres?

Scientists who were studying crops grown in the Chernobyl exclusion zone decided to use some of their leftover grain to produce alcohol. That experiment became a social enterprise that made and sold a spirit drink called appropriately enough Atomik. The aim was to show that slightly radioactive fruit grown in orchards in or near the contaminated exclusion zone that surrounds Chernobyls nuclear power plant could be distilled into a spirit that was no more radioactive than any other. Profits were channelled into communities that live in deprived areas close to the zone. Now as Russian troops occupy the land where that fruit is grown and harvested this unusual company is making a defiant marketing move by releasing two more premium drinks and donating profits to help Ukraine\s refugees. Image caption The land around the nuclear power plant abandoned since the 1986 accident is now occupied by Russian forces While the future of an enterprise that makes a niche spirit might seem insignificant amid the ongoing crisis in Ukraine it is an example of how decades of progress has been upended by war. Why there was a radiation spike at Chernobyl Chernobyl vodka made in exclusion zone After 30 years of studying the exclusion zone the scientists who set up the Atomik project enabled people on contaminated land to sell their own produce. It was a small but significant milestone in the recovery of a patch of Ukraine that was largely abandoned after the nuclear catastrophe in 1986. Now that whole region where we harvest our fruit for production is occupied by Russian forces explained Kyrylo Korychenskyi an environmental researcher and member of the Atomik team. Russian forces seized control of the now defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the first few days of the invasion. Image caption The damaged reactor is entombed by a steel confinement structure Military machinery kicking up radioactive dust in the usually carefully controlled zone caused a spike in radiation levels. The information we\re getting from the region is very bad says Kyrylo. Russian forces go into the villages and put their tanks in the middle of people\s gardens. In the heart of the exclusion zone Ukrainian authorities have accused Russian forces of looting and destroying a new research laboratory designed to process and analyse radioactive samples and to monitor the zone. Prof Jim Smith is one of the founders of Atomik and a scientist at the University of Portsmouth. He has spent much of his career studying the exclusion zone and says that decades of progress are now being destroyed. IMAGE SOURCE ATOMIK Image caption Kyrylo Korychenskyi at the distillery before the war in Ukraine The communities who have been suffering for 35 years are now suffering even more he told BBC News. We used to worry about the risk from radioactive strontium in cities] that are now being bombed. The future of the Atomik project - and that of the people who live and grow fruit in their orchards near the exclusion zone - is uncertain. If the war has ended by the time the next harvest season comes around Kyrylo - who remains in his home in Kyiv with his wife and children - says he hopes to keep going. He hopes to go back to his pre-war life and pick up the project where he left off. I think people there will need money and help because the Chernobyl accident for this territory will no longer be the worst thing that happened there.

Published 24 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE PHOTONEWS VIA GETTY IMAGES Image caption US President Joe Biden will attend G7 Nato and EU summits in Brussels Leaders of the worlds seven richest nations are gathering in Brussels to decide what further measures to take against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. They are holding an emergency summit on the same day that leaders of Nato and the EU also meet in Brussels. Ukraine\s President Volodymyr Zelensky says the trio of meetings will show who is our friend who is our partner and who sold us out and betrayed us. Western leaders meet to discuss Ukraine support What is the G7? The G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world\s seven largest so-called advanced economies which dominate global trade and the international financial system. They are Canada France Germany Italy Japan the UK and the United States. Russia joined in 1998 creating the G8 but was excluded in 2014 for its takeover of Crimea. China has never been a member despite its large economy and having the worlds biggest population. Its relatively low level of wealth per person means its not seen as an advanced economy in the way the G7 members are. Throughout the year G7 ministers and officials hold meetings form agreements and publish joint statements on global events. Germany took over the G7 presidency in January 2022 which means it will host the organisations annual summit in June. The EU is not a member of the G7 but attends the annual summit. What is the G7 doing about Ukraine? Between them the G7 nations have already imposed on Russia the biggest package of sanctions ever imposed on a large economy. They have blocked the country from international commerce and the global financial system and they have frozen the assets of its wealthiest individuals. G7 countries who are members of the Nato security alliance have also provided Ukraine with weapons and other military equipment. What is Nato and how is it helping Ukraine? IMAGE SOURCE NUR VIA GETTY IMAGES Image caption Volodymyr Zelensky says the G7 meeting will show who is our friend ... and who sold us out and betrayed us. What else could G7 countries do? The question is whether G7 leaders are prepared to take harsher steps against Russia which would also hurt their own economies. One key issue is whether to restrict completely the import of Russian oil and gas. The US is banning all Russian oil and gas imports and the UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Ukraines leaders are keen for other G7 nations to follow suit. However European nations get a quarter of their oil and 40% of their gas from Russia and so far the EU has only agreed to reduce its Russian gas imports by two-thirds. Germany has already suspended progress of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. It is designed to take gas from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to Lubmin in Germany under the Baltic Sea. IMAGE SOURCE AFP Image caption Nord Stream 2 would have doubled gas exports to Germany But in a tweet the Ukrainian foreign ministry urged member states to go further calling on leaders to stop financing the war stop paying for Russian energy. One suggested solution is for European nations to strike a deal with the US to import more of its liquefied natural gas. The G7 summit could provide an opportunity to discuss this option. Does the G7 have any power? It cant pass any laws because it is made up of separate nations with their own democratic processes. However some of its past decisions have had global effects. For example the G7 played crucial role in setting up a global fund to fight malaria and Aids in 2002.

Mr Khan joined a large crowd that gathered near Hyde Park ahead of a march in solidarity with the war-torn country. The Labour mayor said the actions of the UK government compared with other European countries were embarrassing. Mr Khan said it needed to be made much more easier for those who are fleeing Ukraine to come here. Earlier this month the government opened it Homes for Ukraine scheme which allows UK nationals to individually sponsor a Ukrainian nationals visa so that those without family connections can still come to live with a host family in the UK.

Nato the G7 and the EU are all holding meetings in a display of unity rarely seen by the West. Mr Biden will take part in all three the first ever visit by a US president to an EU summit in Brussels. But his visit to Brussels is not just about symbolism. Russias invasion of Ukraine has given the Western defensive alliance Nato a renewed sense of purpose. And as the EU attempts to sever energy ties with Russia it needs to forge and reinforce other relationships particularly with the US. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was due to appear by video link at all three summits. Natos 30 presidents and prime ministers will agree greater support for Ukraine and new troop deployments for Eastern allies. Their aim is to show solidarity to Kyiv though only up to a point. Many but not all have been willing to supply weapons. The UK said it would use both the G7 and Nato meetings to substantively increase defensive lethal aid to Ukraine. But the alliance has also made clear it wont become more directly involved and Mr Zelenskys repeated requests for a no-fly zone over Ukraine have pretty much been ignored. Nor is it clear how Nato would respond if Russia were to dramatically escalate the conflict in Ukraine - such as an attack on a Western weapons convoy the use of chemical or even tactical nuclear weapons. Natos red lines have so far been drawn at its borders. Why cant Ukraine join Nato? Collective defence For the past few weeks 30000 Nato troops from 25 countries have been training in Norway as part of Exercise Cold Response a long-planned exercise that has now taken on more significance. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Soldiers from Sweden which is not part of Nato joined thousands of troops on exercise in Norway Like Ukraine Norway borders Russia. The key difference is that as a Nato member Norway is covered by a commitment to collective defence - an attack on one is an attack on all. I think an exercise like this is pretty good to have to prove to countries like Russia… that you don\t want to mess with Nato a young Norwegian conscript called Peder told the BBC. Nato leaders are focused on how to boost their own defences. Theyve already sent thousands more troops to the alliances eastern flank along with more air defence batteries warships and aircraft. Five challenges for Biden in Europe Nato to send more troops to Eastern Europe This says Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is the new normal following Russia\s invasion of Ukraine. Russia will get exactly what it didn\t want - more not less Nato near its border. Nato battlegroups will stretch all the way from the Baltic to the Black Sea for the foreseeable future. Two EU countries that are not members of Nato - Sweden and Finland - contributed troops to the exercise in Norway. They appear to be edging closer and closer to Nato in the wake of Russias invasion. President Trump once questioned the very existence of Nato and French President Emmanuel Macron once called it brain dead. But President Biden\s visit to Brussels is proof that he sees it as being more important than ever to curb a more aggressive Russia. Dizzying EU unity Defence strategy will also play a part in an EU summit where leaders will approve plans that aim to pull member states closer together on military planning intelligence and procurement. One ambition is to have a rapidly deployable force of 5000 troops. It\s all part of the theme of strategic autonomy championed by Mr Macron. The argument is that a more sovereign Europe is a safer Europe whether thats by securing reliable supplies of energy and semiconductor chips or by boosting military spending. But the trickiest subject for the European Unions 27 member states is fast becoming the future of energy supplies as they try to look beyond Russia. After an initial dizzying display of unity on sanctions across all 27 member states there are now obvious ruptures over what to do next. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption EU leaders have reacted fast to Russias invasion with a series of hard-hitting sanctions German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has publicly denounced the idea of banning Russian gas and oil imports arguing it will drag Europe into a recession. Sanctions must not hit the European states harder than the Russian leadership. That is our principle he said on the eve of the summit. Blood money Soaring energy prices are also a concern to be discussed by EU leaders on Friday. But there are nations agitating for action as they voice deep discomfort about handing cash to the Kremlin via energy payments. It\s blood money said one central European diplomat. I don\t think some countries understand the gravity of the situation. President Bidens ability to offer Europe more US Liquefied Natural Gas is a key watch at Thursdays summit. The US is the worlds largest producer of natural gas. He is also expected to announce more sanctions on Russian political figures as well as so-called oligarchs. But the prospect of fresh EU sanctions this week is being played down. Some in Brussels call it fatigue while others insist it\s the right time to take stock.

Published 24 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Measures designed to damage Russias economy have been introduced by countries opposed to its invasion of Ukraine. This has led to higher prices for Russian households and shortages of some goods. What are sanctions? Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another to stop it acting aggressively or breaking international law. They are among the toughest actions nations can take short of going to war. What sanctions have been imposed on Russia? Military goods and mercenaries A ban on the export of dual-use goods - items with both a civilian and military purpose such as vehicle parts - has been imposed by the UK EU and US. This is reportedly having an impact on some Russian manufacturers. Ukraine says Russias main armoured vehicle factory has run out of parts to make and repair tanks. It also says a tractor plant has stopped production because of a shortage of foreign-made parts. The UK is also imposing sanctions on Russias Wagner Group - a private military firm thought to function as an arms-length unit of the Russian military. Flights All Russian flights have been banned from US UK EU and Canadian airspace. The UK has also banned private jets chartered by Russians. Luxury goods The UK says it will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia - including vehicles high-end fashion and art. The EU has already imposed a ban. The UK will also put a 35% tax on some imports from Russia including vodka. Targeting individuals The US EU and UK have together sanctioned over 1000 Russian individuals and businesses including wealthy business leaders known as oligarchs who are considered close to the Kremlin. One high-profile oligarch sanctioned by the UK is Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich. IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption Roman Abramovich was attempting to sell Chelsea FC Assets belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov are also being frozen in the US EU UK and Canada. However many Russian oligarchs have put their properties and wealth under other names which means they may be beyond the reach of the UKs sanctions. The UK is also limiting the sale of golden visas which allowed wealthy Russians to get British residency rights. The hunt for superyachts of sanctioned Russians Oil and gas The US is banning all Russian oil and gas imports and the UK will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. The EU which gets a quarter of its oil and 40% of its gas from Russia says it will switch to alternative supplies and make Europe independent from Russian energy well before 2030. Germany has put on hold permission for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to open. Could the world survive without Russian oil and gas? Financial measures Western countries have frozen the assets of Russias central bank to stop it using its $630bn (£470bn) of foreign currency reserves. This has caused the value of the rouble to slump by 22% since the start of the year. That in turn has pushed up the price of imported goods and led to a 14% rise in Russias rate of inflation. Some Russian banks are being removed from the international financial messaging system Swift which is used to transfer money across borders. This will delay payments to Russia for energy exports. Other UK sanctions include: major Russian banks excluded from the UK financial system all Russian banks have had their assets frozen the Russian state and major companies are not be able to raise finance or borrow money in the UK a limit placed on deposits Russians can make at UK banks The EU also said it would target 70% of the Russian banking market and key state-owned firms. What are companies doing? A growing number of international companies including McDonalds Coca-Cola and Starbucks have suspended trading in Russia. After facing fierce criticism for continuing to operate in Russia Nestle has withdrawn some of its brands including KitKat and Nesquik but will still sell essential foods. However a number of other Western brands including Marks and Spencer Burger King and hotel groups Marriott and Accor say they cant pull out from Russia because their businesses there operate under complex franchise deals. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia How has Russia reacted to sanctions? Russia\s President Putin has said he will make unfriendly nations pay for their imports of Russian gas in roubles which would push up the value of the currency. Russia has banned exports of more than 200 products until the end of 2022 including telecoms medical vehicle agricultural electrical equipment and timber. In addition it is blocking interest payments to foreign investors who hold government bonds and banning Russian firms from paying overseas shareholders. It has stopped foreign investors who hold billions of dollars worth of Russian stocks and bonds from selling them. Could Russia turn to China as sanctions bite?

Rezantsev was the commander of Russias 49th combined army. A western official said he was the seventh general to die in Ukraine and the second lieutenant general - the highest rank officer reportedly killed. It is thought that low morale among Russian troops has forced senior officers closer to the front line. In a conversation intercepted by the Ukrainian military a Russian soldier complained that Rezantsev had claimed the war would be over within hours just four days after it began. Ukrainian media reported on Friday that the general was killed at the Chornobaivka airbase near Kherson which Russia is using as a command post and has been attacked by Ukraines military several times. Another lieutenant general Andrei Mordvichev was reportedly killed by a Ukrainian strike on the same base. Kherson was the first Ukrainian city to be occupied by Russian forces although there are reports that daily protests are held there against the Russian occupation. Although Russia has confirmed the death of only one general Kyiv and western officials believe up to seven have been killed in fighting since the war began. However the death of Maj Gen Magomed Tushayev of the Chechen national guard has been disputed. It is unusual for such senior Russian officers to be so close to the battlefield and western officials believe that they have been forced to move towards the front lines to deal with low morale among Russian troops. The unexpectedly strong Ukrainian resistance poor Russian equipment and a high death toll amongst Russian troops are all thought to be contributing to the low morale. Russian forces are believed to be relying in part on open communication systems for example mobile phones and analogue radios which are easy to intercept and could give away the locations of high-ranking officers. A person inside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskys inner circle told the Wall Street Journal that Ukraine had a military intelligence team dedicated to targeting Russias officer class. So far Vladimir Putin has only referred to the death of one general thought to be Maj Gen Andrey Sukhovetsky in a speech soon after the start of the war. Russia says 1351 soldiers have died since the war began in Ukraine although Kyiv and western officials say the number is much higher. Russias lost generals Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed by a Ukrainian strike on the Chornobaivka airbase near the city of Kherson. He was promoted to lieutenant general last year and was commander of the 49th combined army of Russias southern military district. He is said to have taken part in Russias military operation in Syria. Andrei Mordvichev was killed by a strike on the Chornobaivka airbase near Kherson according to Ukrainian officials. He was the commander of Russias 8th combined army of the southern military district. His death was reported on 18 March. Maj Gen Oleg Mityaev reportedly died somewhere near the city of Mariupol a city in south-east Ukraine which has seen some of the heaviest fighting so far. The nationalist Azov regiment claims to have killed him. He was a commander of the Russian armys 150th motorised rifle division a relatively new unit formed in 2016 and based in the Rostov region close to the Ukrainian border. Ukraine claims that the unit was created in order to take part in the conflict in separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine although Russia denies that its military was involved in fighting there. Maj Gen Andrei Kolesnikov of the 29th combined army was killed in fighting on 11 March according to official Ukrainian sources. The circumstances of his death were not given. After Kolesnikov became the third Russian general reportedly killed in Ukraine one western official told the Press Association that the Russian army may be suffering from low morale which is why high-ranking military officers are moving closer to the front line. Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov chief of staff of Russias 41st combined army was killed on 7 March outside the eastern city of Kharkiv according to Ukraines defence ministry. Kharkiv close to the Russian border has come under sustained attack from Russian forces. Ukraines military released a recording of what it said was two Russian security service officials discussing Gerasimovs death and complaining that their secure communication networks no longer worked in Ukraine. Gerasimov was involved in the second Chechen war the Russian military operation in Syria and in the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. Maj Gen Andrey Sukhovetsky a deputy commander at the same unit as Gerasimov was reportedly killed by a sniper on 3 March. Like Gerasimov Sukhovetsky was part of Russias military operations in Crimea and in Syria. Unlike the other generals Sukhovetskys death was reported in the Russian media and Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed in a speech that a general had died in Ukraine.

A private helicopter belonging to Russian firm HeliCo Group LLC has also been detained. Western nations opposed to the Russian presidents invasion of Ukraine have introduced a raft of sanctions designed to cripple Russias economy and hurt its wealthiest citizens.

But in its latest offering Humble has raised more than £10m exclusively for charities benefitting Ukraine. It is providing a bundle of 120 games and items usually valued at more than £1800 that it now offers for a minimum donation of only £30.52. Kamini Tiwari vice-president of social impact at Humble praised the players who have put up their money to get the games. We\re very very happy that our community is leaning in to support us she said. I think they also like us recognise that need is so great. We are constantly humbled - pardon the pun - by our community. Throughout the year and particularly during times of crisis and disaster it\s been great to see that across the gaming industry so many others are leaning in as well. Chucklefish Games makers of WarGroove and Starbound is one of the independent developers based in London that has offered up its games to the bundle. Alexis Trust communications manager at the studio said she felt it was their duty to help those in need. She said the firm\s partners Lithuania-based Hidden Layer Games which made the game Inmost is a two-man team from Ukraine and Russia. Throughout the project the team experienced first-hand the difficulty of working between borders during a time of political tension and so made the difficult decision to move together to Lithuania where their dream project could actually become a reality. When the Russian military invaded Ukraine we felt that it was our duty to extend that help to other families in whatever capacity we could. IMAGE SOURCE CHUCKLEFISH GAMES Image caption Chucklefish released indie hit Wargroove in 2019 But Humble isnt the only bundle right now aiming to help those in Ukraine. There is also the now-completed itch.io bundle which raised £4.7m by offering up 1000 games in exchange for a minimum donation of £7.56. Brandon Sheffield creative director of Necrosoft Games organised the bundle. He told the BBC he thinks the cause really resonated with people. And he said it was surprisingly easy to persuade developers of indie hits like Celeste and Superhot to help. Believe it or not it didn\t take very much convincing at all he said. Everyone was pretty much ready to help. The publisher Raw Fury joined the itch.io platform just so that they could put four of their games into this. The charities which benefitted from the itch.io bundle were International Medical Corps as well as the Voices of Children Foundation - a Ukrainian charity which provides support to children affected by trauma caused by war. I feel like that\s incredibly important for the future of Ukraine Mr Sheffield said. I chose this local organisation that\s already there. Because they\re there they\ve been like impromptu shelters going around and using the money that they\ve been donated to try to protect the people in Kyiv and other places where they can actually access them. And Andy Pearson chief marketing officer of British publisher PQube Games that has donated games for the bundle compared what was happening in the games industry to some of the big musical fundraising events of the past. It\s phenomenal. It exceeded the initial expectations and then continued to go on from there. It was amazing. I am thinking now - has this been done before? And it has - it\s like Live Aid - those big big events where you had lots of creators all coming together in one versus a single person trying to contribute. That\s what\s really helped establish this.]Kayleigh Poacher: Help for Ukraine,The South Norfolk business coming to the rescue of women and girls in Ukraine.,UnknownUkraine: Mother's poem sent with teddy bears to warzone children,Abigail Horne's verse has been translated into Ukrainian and attached to soft toys sent to evacuees.,Ukraine: Mothers poem sent with teddy bears to warzone children Published 26 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE ABIGAIL HORNE Image caption Abigail Horne said that her words may give even a slight bit of comfort was more than my mind can comprehend A woman has written a poem that has been translated into Ukrainian and sent with one thousand teddy bears to children fleeing the war zone.

The combat capabilities of the Ukrainian armed forces have been substantially reduced which allows us to concentrate our main efforts on achieving the main goal: the liberation of Donbas he added referring to an area in eastern Ukraine largely in the hands of Russian-backed separatists. Russias military has been bombarding and trying to encircle key Ukrainian cities such as the capital Kyiv which Gen Rudskoy characterised as an attempt to tie down Ukraines forces elsewhere in the country while Russia focuses on the east. Ukraine\s President Volodymyr Zelensky said his troops had landed powerful blows on Russia and called on Moscow to recognise the need for serious peace talks. By restraining Russia\s actions our defenders are leading the Russian leadership to a simple and logical idea: talk is necessary. Meaningful. Urgent. Fair. For the sake of the result not for the sake of the delay he said. The exact end goal of Russia\s invasion has not been made explicit but President Vladimir Putin described the aims as the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine characterising the government\s leaders as a neo-Nazi junta killing millions in a genocide of Russian speakers. The claims have no basis and Ukraine and its Western allies dismiss them as a pretext to carry out an unprovoked war. Russian troops first tried to encircle the capital Kyiv. But after bombarding and then seizing several towns to the north-west they were forced back by Ukraines military which is now trying to surround thousands of Russian soldiers. In a US assessment on Friday a defence official said that Russia had made no progress in its advance on Ukraines second largest city Kharkiv and that Ukraine could recapture Kherson. Russias army has had greater success in the south seizing towns and cities such as Kherson and making some gains in the east. Moscow now claims 93% of the Donbas region of Luhansk is under the control of Russian-backed separatists with 54% of the other part of Donbas Donetsk in their hands. More than a third of the entire area was under separatist control before the war began. Andriy Yermak chief of staff to Ukraine\s President Zelensky cautioned against the suggestion that Russia had abandoned plans to seize the rest of Ukraine. It\s a big danger before war is finished to make a public prognosis especially when you are fighting against one of the biggest armies in the world Mr Yermak told the Financial Times. What next for Russias war? Russia\s announcement that it will focus on the liberation of the Donbas is likely to mean a more concerted effort to push beyond the line of contact that separates Ukrainian government-held territory in the east of the country from the Russian backed separatist people\s republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. Western officials believe the announcement implies that Moscow knows that its pre-war strategy has failed. Russia is recognising that it can\t pursue its operations on multiple axes simultaneously one official said. As many as 10 new battalion tactical groups are being generated and put into Russias operations especially in the Donbas. Western officials have been concerned for some time that Russia will attempt to encircle and envelop Ukraines best fighting units which are stationed along the line of contact. If more Russian firepower particularly air power is concentrated in the east those concerns will rise. I hope that\s where the Western supply of arms will make a significant contribution to Ukrainian forces one official said. Is Russia admitting invasion not going to plan?

Analysts have previously suggested Ukraine may be deliberately targeting senior Russian military officers. Ukraines death toll since the war began is now well into the thousands with 10 million people displaced within Ukraine and beyond its borders. So far the UN has only confirmed 1081 civilian deaths in Ukraine but the true number is far higher with 300 deaths reported in the attack on a theatre in Mariupol alone. More than 3.7 million people have fled abroad including 2.2 million to Poland.

He said: These include the quick implementation of sanctions against Russia and financial support for aid agencies supporting the Ukrainian people. But supporting these propositions through our parliamentary process is another important way we can make very clear that the Bailiwick stands with Ukraine and is firmly opposed to the Russian Federation\s invasion. He added: There is no justification for the horrific violence being inflicted upon innocent Ukrainian men women and children.

It says the targeting of healthcare facilities has become part of the strategy and tactics of modern warfare. A recent casualty on 8 March was the newly refurbished central hospital in Izyum south of Kharkiv. It was hit by what the Ukrainian authorities said were Russian shells. Video and photos posted online by the citys deputy mayor showed extensive damage to the main hospital building. A new reception area built last year was completely destroyed. The footage has been verified by the BBC and other media outlets although the exact circumstances of the attack are impossible to establish at this time. After the first bombing the windows of the hospital blew out the deputy mayor Volodymyr Matsokin told the BBC. A second attack destroyed the hospitals operating rooms he added. Ukraine: The doctors racing aid from the UK to the front line Oxygen stocks running dangerously low in Ukraine Ukraine war: The road to safety for Ukraines cancer children That day hospital staff were treating children pregnant women and three newborn babies as well as soldiers and civilians injured in fierce fighting in the region according to the Ukrainian authorities. They were sheltering in the basement at the time of the attack and no-one was killed. The government had invested millions to provide good facilities with modern equipment said Mr Matsokin. Patients had to climb out of the rubble on their own to escape. The BBC has contacted the Russian embassy in London about the attack but has received no response although in the past Moscow has denied deliberately targeting civilians. Since 24 February the WHO has reviewed and verified 72 separate attacks on healthcare facilities in Ukraine causing at least 71 deaths and 37 injuries. IMAGE SOURCE GOOGLE (L) AND VOLODYMR MATSOKIN (R) Image caption The central hospital in Izyum in August 2021 and after an attack on 8 March 2022 Most have damaged hospitals medical transports and supply stores but the WHO has also recorded the probable abduction or detention of healthcare staff and patients. We are concerned that this number is increasing daily the WHO\s Ukraine country representative Jarno Habicht told the BBC. Health facilities should be safe places for both doctors and nurses but also patients to turn to for treatment. This should not happen. Because the war in Ukraine is an international armed conflict between two states the Geneva Conventions apply. Expanded in the aftermath of World War Two the conventions set out the basic rights of civilians and military personnel and establish protection for the wounded and sick. They were ratified by what was then the Soviet Union in 1954. War in Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby WATCH: Destruction of Ukraines cities from above ZELENSKY: How Ukraines leader tailors his addresses READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Under Article 18 of the Conventions civilian hospitals may in no circumstances be the object of attack but shall at all times be respected and protected. A breach of that rule can be investigated by the International Criminal Court in the Hague and if found to be a war crime individual perpetrators can be prosecuted and punished. There are though exemptions to the Conventions. The protection from attack is lost if the medical facility is placed near a legitimate military target or is thought to be committing an act harmful to the enemy. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) that could include the use of a hospital as a shield for healthy fighters or the staging of a medical unit in a position which impedes an enemy attack. IMAGE SOURCE SERGEI ORLOV Image caption Aftermath of a Russian air strike on a maternity and children’s hospital in Mariupol Neve Gordon professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University of London said: What we have today in effect is a situation where hospitals and medical units have become fair game. If there are soldiers outside the hospital or it is simply next to a train station it can be attacked. Or it could be that a wounded soldier has a cellphone and is calling other troops and telling them that there is someone nearby. All these loopholes render it possible to claim the attack was legitimate. The ICRC says that in theory before targeting a hospital which might be in breach of those rules the attacking side should always give a warning with a time limit and the other side must have ignored that warning. There is no evidence this has happened in the Ukraine conflict. Prof Gordon would like to see a far stronger blanket ban on any attack on medical facilities under international law similar to the ban on torture adopted by the United Nations which came into force in 1987. From Vietnam to Syria Exemptions to the Geneva Conventions have been used to justify attacks on hospitals and medical units in post-World War Two conflicts from Korea and Vietnam onwards. The trend though appears to be accelerating rapidly driven in part by the use of ballistic missiles drones and other longer range munitions. The US advocacy group Physicians for Human Rights claims that Russian or local forces have been linked to at least 244 separate attacks on healthcare facilities in Syria since 2011. At one point the charity Médecins Sans Frontières even made the decision to stop sharing the GPS co-ordinates of some health clinics it operated with the Syrian government or its Russian allies amid concerns they were more likely to become direct targets as a result. Russian officials denied deliberately attacking hospitals in Syria and suggested jihadists in the country were routinely sheltering in protected civilian buildings. IMAGE SOURCE LUHANSK REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION Image caption A photograph released on 18 March by Ukrainian authorities showing a hospital damaged by shelling in Sievierodonetsk The WHO is concerned that all this means attacks on medical facilities are fast becoming part of the wider strategy and tactics of modern warfare regardless of the Geneva Conventions rules. Destroying health facilities it warned is about the destruction of hope and the denial of basic human rights. We\ve never seen globally... this rate of attacks on healthcare its emergencies director Michael Ryan told a news conference this week. This crisis is reaching a point where the health system in Ukraine is teetering on the brink. It needs to be supported… but how can you do that if the very infrastructure that those people will go in to support is under direct attack? You can follow Jim on Twitter.

By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes BBC News Tokyo Published 26 March Share Related Topics World War Two IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Former Japan PM Shinzo Abe has shocked Japan by saying it should think about nuclear weapons How could Japan ever contemplate getting nukes? Its a ridiculous idea. Japan is the only country in the world to have suffered a nuclear attack. Twice. Japan acquiring nuclear weapons is unthinkable. The people would never accept it. Right? Right. Or so the story has gone for the last 77 years. But in the last few weeks one Japanese politician has started suggesting otherwise. He is Shinzo Abe Japans longest serving post-war prime minister. Mr Abe has begun saying loudly and publicly that Japan should indeed think seriously and urgently about nuclear weapons. What we are talking about here is a fundamental break with Japans post-war commitment to pacifism - something enshrined in its post-war constitution. But its no coincidence this call-to-arms has come just as Russia has invaded Ukraine. For those like Mr Abe who have long yearned for a fully re-armed Japan the invasion of Ukraine serves as a useful example of what can happen to countries that dont defend themselves properly against bigger better armed and more aggressive neighbours. Richard McGregor of the Lowy Institute in Sydney and author of Asias Reckoning believes Abe thinks the time is right to push genuine debate in Japan and get on to the serious work of really trying to persuade the Japanese public. Women survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs I think that\s the holy grail here. I think he wants to try and move public opinion which has been frankly pretty stubborn he told the BBC. Pretty stubborn is an understatement. A survey conducted last year found 75% of Japanese want the country to sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Mr Abe\s call for a nuclear debate was met with outrage from atom bomb survivors\ groups in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Current Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (who is from Hiroshima) was quick to slap down his predecessor calling Mr Abe\s suggestion unacceptable. But Mr Abe is an astute politician. He knows Ukraine has come as a huge shock and he knows the Japanese public is worried about an unpredictable nuclear-armed North Korea and an increasingly aggressive China. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Japan\s current prime minister Fumio Kishida has called Mr Abe\s suggestion unacceptable Professor Yoichi Shimada is a conservative academic and long-time friend and advisor to Shinzo Abe. He thinks it\s imperative for Japan to have some kind of independent attacking power against China or North Korea Professor Shimada says. And that includes possibly a nuclear arsenal. But he also knows it would be suicidal for any politician to advocate for Japan to have nuclear weapons so he wants to activate the debate. The official position of the Japanese government now is to rely on US extended (nuclear) deterrents. But Japan doesn\t allow the United States to deploy nuclear weapons in Japan. That frankly is selfish. And so Mr Abe is not suggesting Japan build its own nuclear weapons. Hes suggesting it borrow some from America. Reality Check: Where are the worlds nuclear weapons? Largely forgotten in the post-cold war world is the fact is that Germany Belgium Italy and the Netherlands all store US nuclear weapons on their soil. More than that if there were a nuclear war these non-nuclear weapons states could deliver those weapons to targets on behalf of the US using their own aircraft. This is what Mr Abe is now proposing for Japan. It all still feels very far-fetched. Japanese law has explicitly banned any nuclear weapons from its soil since 1971. But Mr Abe is not alone in calling for that ban to now be debated. Ryozo Kato was Japans longest serving post-war ambassador to the United States and is perhaps the most ardent advocate of the Japan-US alliance. But he says with a nuclear-armed North Korea Japan can no longer just to rely on the US nuclear umbrella. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption North Korea has been ramping up its nuclear testing and long-range missile capabilities It may not be China he says. Some crazy leader may decide to fire nuclear weapons at Japan. Or they could use them for political intimidation. Japan is quite vulnerable to intimidation. We have to do more in defence terms. Japans pacifism was foisted on it by the American occupiers after World War II. Junking this has always seemed far-fetched. But its something both the US government and much of Japans political elite now support. Many Americans wish they hadn\t bound Japan with the peace constitution says Richard McGregor of the Lowy Institute. We shouldn\t forget that people like Abe also deeply resent the Americans imposing this constitution on them. They obviously bottled up their annoyance because they want the alliance with America. They know they can\t handle China on their own. There is a kind of seller\s remorse and buyer\s remorse on the peace constitution on both sides of the Pacific. In fact Japan is already far from being a true pacifist state whatever its constitution proclaims. Its navy is now amongst the most powerful in the world - quite a bit larger than Britains Royal Navy. What Japan lacks is long-range strike capability. Prof Yoichi Shimada says the consensus is that must now change. The position that Japan should have weapons which can hit the enemy territory I think that in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party the vast majority of the politicians thinks it\s necessary for Japan to have such capability. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Professor Shimada says the possibility of Russia waging nuclear war on Ukraine has spooked Japanese politicians Prof Shimada says Vladimir Putins threats against Ukraine have only made that more urgent. Would Putin press the nuclear button? President Putin actually referred to the use of nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear state. That amounts to a game changer for many politicians in Japan. Russia is one of the permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations. We all know that Putin is brutal. But it is very shocking even for him. Unlike Ukraine Japan has a full alliance with the United States and a commitment from Washington to retaliate against any country that attacks Japan including with nuclear weapons. That has worked while America has reigned supreme. But in Asia China is now rapidly approaching military parity with America. And then came the election of Donald Trump. Mr Trump said that you have to do your own security says Hiromi Murakami author of The Abe Legacy. He said it explicitly. But I think the overall trend of US is basically the same as Mr Trump. You can\t totally rely on the US anymore. For some like Ambassador Kato the answer is to strengthen the US-Japan alliance - and for Japan to take on more of the burden of defending its own neighbourhood. For Prof Shimada it could mean one day Japan will have to develop its own nuclear deterrent. One thing everyone I spoke to agreed is that Japan must somehow get over the taboo of talking about its own defence. This has been avoided for many many years. says Ms Murakami. But the Japanese leadership really needs to bring this to the table and show it to the public. We can\t live in this fake world any longer. This Ukraine situation is really shocking and I hope that it will trigger the leadership and the general public to really think.]Newsday: Ukraine: Mixed reports on Russian military reversals as conflict continues,"Russian forces are suffering from supply and logistical problems, says US and Ukraine",UnknownHomes for Ukraine: Executive Office 'needs help' to match refugees,The Executive Office says it needs further assistance to make links through Foreign Office contacts.,Homes for Ukraine: Executive Office needs help to match refugees By Claire Graham BBC News NI Published 25 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption Millions of people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion The Executive Office has called on the UK government to provide more help to match refugees to Northern Ireland sponsors.

It was an experience I would not want to repeat and she said seeing her home country bombed was mentally challenging and a shock they were not prepared for. The mother and daughter were grateful to be safely in Suffolk as it was really important to have a place to live where they were not afraid.

Ukraine war: Dozens of Russian diplomats expelled by four EU nations,"More than 40 diplomats are told to leave by Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland and the Czech Republic.",Ukraine war: Dozens of Russian diplomats expelled by four EU nations Published 4 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmès told MPs that 21 Russian diplomats will be expelled In a co-ordinated move four EU countries are expelling more than 40 Russian diplomats suspected of spying. Ireland Belgium the Netherlands and the Czech Republic issued expulsion orders to a total of 43 embassy staffers on Tuesday afternoon. The move follows similar actions taken by other EU members including Poland in the past week. Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmès told MPs that the expulsions were related to our national security. Speaking to parliament Ms Wilmès said that 21 members of staff at the Russian embassy in Brussels and at the consulate in Antwerp had been asked to leave the country giving them two weeks to depart. She added that the move was made in conjunction with Belgium\s neighbour the Netherlands whose foreign ministry said it was expelling 17 Russian diplomats it considered to be secretly active as intelligence officers. Irelands Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Micheál Martin told MPs that his government had expelled four Russian diplomats after receiving security advice from its intelligence officials. Mr Martin said the officials had been asked to leave the state because their activities are not in accordance with the international standards of diplomatic behaviour. Russia\s embassy in Dublin said it rejected the groundless decision adding that it would deteriorate further Russian-Irish relations. Meanwhile a Czech official told the AFP news agency that the diplomat expelled from Prague was Russias deputy ambassador. Together with our Allies we are reducing the Russian intelligence presence in the EU the Czech foreign ministry tweeted. On Wednesday Poland expelled 45 accredited diplomats for engaging in suspected espionage in the country. Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski wrote on Twitter that Polish intelligence officials were dismantling the Russian special services network in our country. And earlier this month Bulgaria Lithuania Latvia and Estonia expelled a total of 20 Russian embassy staffers in connection with activities contrary to their diplomatic status. Russia has tended to respond to such decisions with reciprocal moves and earlier today announced the expulsion of 10 diplomats from Estonia Latvia and Lithuania.

EU signs US gas deal to curb reliance on Russia,The liquefied natural gas deal with US is part of EU attempts to reduce reliance on Russian energy.,EU signs US gas deal to curb reliance on Russia Published 25 March comments Comments Share IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES The US and the EU have announced a major deal on liquified natural gas in an attempt to reduce Europes reliance on Russian energy. The agreement will see the US provide the EU with extra gas equivalent to around 10% of the gas it currently gets from Russia by the end of the year. The bloc has already said it will cut Russian gas use in response to Russias invasion of Ukraine. Russia currently supplies about 40% of the EUs gas needs. The new deal will involve the US and other countries supplying an extra 15 billion cubic metres of gas on top of last years 22 billion cubic metres. The new total will represent around 24% of the gas currently imported from Russia. The eventual aim is for the US and international partners to provide about 50 billion cubic metres per year to the EU. Cutting reliance on Russia will mean generating more renewable energy and improving energy efficiency as well as increasing imports. Ukraine war: How reliant is the world on Russia for oil and gas? Why are gas bills so high and whats the energy price cap? The deal was announced on Friday during a three-day visit by US President Joe Biden to Brussels. Mr Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen discussed Russias invasion of Ukraine and offered fresh support to Kyiv. Putin is using Russia\s energy resources to coerce and manipulate its neighbours Mr Biden told reporters in Brussels. He\s used the profits to drive his war machine. He said the long term benefits of the deal would outweigh the short term pain that reducing Russian gas supplies would cause. I know that eliminating Russian gas will have costs for Europe but it\s not only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint it\s going to put us on a much stronger strategic footing. President von der Leyen said: We want as Europeans to diversify away from Russia towards suppliers that we trust that are friends and that are reliable. She pointed out that the target 50 billion cubic metres per year is replacing one-third already of the Russian gas going to Europe today. So we are right on track now to diversify away from Russian gas. The EU gets 40% of its gas from Russia. If its to wean itself off that dependency it needs to get its energy elsewhere. The question is where from? Gas is already piped from Norway - but those pipelines are already operating at maximum capacity. The EU gets relatively little from the North Sea. New supplies will have to come from further afield in the form of LNG - gas thats been chilled and liquified. But theres already intense competition for LNG supplies from countries such as Algeria and Qatar and thats been pushing up prices. The 50 billion cubic metres of gas a year from the US - more than double the current quantity - would certainly be welcome. But it still wouldnt fill the gap if Russian supplies were removed. There are also question marks over how much gas the US can supply how quickly it can increase exports to the EU - and how much those shipments will cost. The EU has been enjoying cheap gas for many years - but now it seems to have accepted that era is coming to an end. Russias war with Ukraine has helped push energy prices to record highs. Energy prices were already rising before the invasion as economies started to recover from the Covid crisis. The Ukraine invasion prompted the EU to pledge to cut Russian gas use by two-thirds this year by hiking imports from other countries and boosting renewable energy. The White House said that greater energy efficiency can be immediately achieved through increasing the use of smart thermostats and heat pumps. The EU said that reductions through energy savings in homes can replace 15.5 billion cubic metres this year and that accelerating wind and solar deployment can replace 20 billion cubic metres. The EUs goal is to save 170 billion cubic metres by 2030 through energy efficiency and by using renewable energy. That 170 billion on top of the planned 50 billion of additional gas from the US and other countries means Europes reliance on Russian gas could be replaced by 2030. Russia sanctions In response to Russias invasion of Ukraine the US is banning all Russian oil and gas imports and the UK will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. The EU has said it will switch to alternative supplies and make Europe independent from Russian energy well before 2030. Germany has put on hold permission for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to open. Meanwhile in the UK petrol prices have hit record highs as oil and gas costs soar. Oil jumped to $139 a barrel at one point earlier this month the highest level for almost 14 years while wholesale gas prices for next-day delivery more than doubled.]

UK minister seeks talks on scheme replacing EU aid fund,Neil O'Brien speaks after Welsh ministers complained of not being involved in plans for the fund.,UK minister seeks talks on scheme replacing EU aid fund By Felicity Evans Political editor Wales Published 23 March Share Related Topics Brexit IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption The A465 near Ebbw Vale was part funded by EU financial aid A UK minister says he has been seeking a meeting with the Welsh economy minister about a new fund to replace EU aid for Wales poorest areas. Minister for Levelling Up Neil O\Brien said he wanted to talk to Vaughan Gething but Welsh ministers were still mulling the offer of a meeting. Welsh ministers have criticised the UK government for not involving them in plans for the Shared Prosperity Fund. Welsh ministers said agreement can be reached based on joint decision making. What does levelling up mean for Wales? Wales to get £46m of EU funds replacement pilot Ministers in Cardiff have also complained that the fund leaves Wales worse off than under the original EU scheme. The details of how the new fund will work have yet to be announced. Mr O\Brien told a committee of Welsh MPs on Wednesday: I am keen to talk about it with my equivalent Vaughan Gething in Wales but at the moment I think they are still deciding if they want to engage in that way. Addressing the Welsh Affairs Committee he said he wanted the Welsh government to be involved in shaping the scheme but they are mulling how they want to play this. We are in the process of talking to Welsh local authorities and other stakeholders he said. I am keen to meet with and work with the Welsh government. Money in local leaders hands Mr OBrien said officials of the two governments were meeting regularly and Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove had met the first ministers of Wales and Scotland before Christmas. We are very open to the Welsh government shaping all the different dimensions of this fund he said. But he also added that UK ministers want local authorities to decide how to spend the money. The one thing we would be keen on and I think this is probably the thing that is making them wonder about whether to meet is that we really want to allocate the funding fully out to local regions within Wales. We\d like to put the money in the hands of local leaders. How has the Welsh government responded? A Welsh government spokesperson said: Welsh ministers have been clear in meetings and in public that an agreement can be reached on the basis of joint decision making. A credible agreement that works for jobs and communities in Wales must go beyond consultation and include a joint approach to the design and delivery of programmes and projects. Officials from both governments are in ongoing dialogue on these issues and Welsh ministers look forward to meeting with UK ministers to discuss their response to our offer of a way forward.

Brexit: 'More needed to explain impact of EU law on NI',A Lords committee warns more information is required on how legal updates will affect Northern Ireland.,Brexit: More needed to explain impact of EU law on NI By John Campbell BBC News NI Economics & Business Editor Published 22 March comments Comments Share Related Topics Brexit IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES/PAUL FAITH Image caption The protocol led to inspections at ports on certain goods imported into Northern Ireland from Great Britain The UK and EU need to do more to explain how updates to EU law could impact Northern Ireland a House of Lords committee has warned. A significant amount of EU law continues to apply in NI under the terms of the Protocol. That body of law is subject to constant technical update and revision. The Lords sub-committee on the protocol says far too much government documentation inadequately explains the implications of EU legislation for NI. The protocol is the Brexit deal that prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EUs single market for goods. That means many EU laws on product standards customs VAT and state aid continue to apply in Northern Ireland. If the EU is bringing forward entirely new laws which will affect Northern Ireland there is a formal consultation process with the UK government through the oversight body known as the Joint Committee. However if the EU is amending or replacing existing laws they automatically apply in Northern Ireland - what is known as dynamic regulatory alignment. In those cases the scrutiny process is based on the UK government producing explanatory memoranda (EM). Extremely poor The Lords sub-committee uses these EMs to decide which issues need detailed analysis. It says these EMs are of inconsistent quality describing some as extremely poor. It praises the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) for the quality of its submissions. However it adds: Too many documents from other departments do not contain sufficient information about the implications of EU legislation for Northern Ireland. The committee suggests the ongoing negotiations on the protocol are being used as an excuse to provide minimal information. Notwithstanding the ongoing discussions... the government has an obligation in the meantime to set out the full implications of EU legislation applying to Northern Ireland under the protocol as it currently operates it says. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? UK and Irish prime ministers discuss protocol What is Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol? The committee also tackles the wider issue of the protocol\s democratic deficit. That refers to the fact that the EU laws which continue to apply in Northern Ireland are not subject to any consent from parliamentarians either at Westminster or Stormont. In October the EU published proposals aimed at enhancing consultation with Northern Ireland business and civic groups. It also said it is planning a website showing EU legislation applicable to Northern Ireland which could include information on pending public consultations for relevant measures. Particular needs The committee says these measures are welcome as far as they go but the EU needs to do more. It suggests a number of ideas such as providing a means for the Northern Ireland Assembly to express a collective view or decision on EU legislation. IMAGE SOURCE PETER DAZELEY/GETTY Image caption If the EU is amending or replacing existing laws they automatically apply in Northern Ireland That could take the form of pre-legislative consultation or a Legislative Consent Mechanism - a non-binding Stormont vote. The EU is likely to be resistant to measures which would give Stormont greater rights than EEA countries - they are non-EU single market participants like Norway. However the committee\s chairman Lord Jay of Ewelme told the BBC that Northern Ireland\s situation was not comparable with the EEA and there does need to be something which takes account of the particular needs of Northern Ireland at a very sensitive time.]
Morlais tidal project on Anglesey gets £31m EU funding,The sum is likely to be the last large grant from the EU's regional funding programme.,Morlais tidal project on Anglesey gets £31m EU funding Published 22 March Share IMAGE SOURCE BLEDDYN JONES-PEARSON Image caption The Morlais scheme in Anglesey aims to develop tidal power generation technologies A major tidal project off Anglesey will benefit from £31m of funding in what is likely to be the last large grant from the EUs regional funding programme. Wales Climate Change Minister Julie James confirmed the funding would be given to Menter Môn for the Morlais infrastructure project. The project aims to develop tidal power generation technologies by providing grid connectivity. It is also expected to create jobs and boost skills in the area. Action on green energy needed now says trade body Power project could be devastating for seabirds No better time to seek investors says deal boss The Morlais project would see a development on 35 sq km (13 sq miles) of seabed generating up to 240MW of electricity from the power of the tides in the Irish Sea. It would make it one of the largest tidal stream energy sites in the world. But environmentalists have warned the plans could have a devastating impact on seabird populations. The Crown Estate will invest a further £1.2m in the Morlais project to support the delivery of its environmental monitoring and mitigation package. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption There are concerns about the impact of the project on local wildlife Ms James said the project is an opportunity for the industry to establish clean resilient and ethical power as a significant part of the global energy system. North Wales minister Lesley Griffiths added: Anglesey and north Wales as a whole are very well placed to play a key role in innovative low carbon energy generation which benefits local communities. Not only will the project be a boost to future low carbon energy production but will also generate jobs and skills in the area. Unlocking the tidal stream sector Wales economy minister Vaughan Gething said there have been considerable opportunities for the marine energy sector through European structural fund programmes. There is no doubt EU funds have been essential in supporting businesses to exploit the great potential of Wales\ wave and tidal resources with a significant investment of £105m in marine energy projects in Wales he said. The Morlais infrastructure project is key to unlocking the development of the tidal stream sector in north Wales bringing a number of economic benefits to the region. With the construction and testing of devices and preparation of infrastructure the project will attract further sector investment enabling the supply chain to grow and with it create higher-skilled jobs.]

Now EU leaders who are here for a two-day summit hope to project an image of unity in the face of Russian aggression in Ukraine. Thats easy when they discuss the big picture. But some details up for debate are clearly divisive amongst member states: such as energy prices impacted by the war EU common defence plans and the enlargement of the bloc to include Ukraine. Yet the bureaucratic often bickering behemoth that is the EU has already been transformed by the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Lets take a step back to get some perspective: Germany is re-booting its military after decades of squeamishness due to the countrys role in World War Two The EU has slapped unprecedented financial sanctions on Russia despite costs to European businesses The EUs Temporary Protection Directive has been used for the first time to help Ukrainian refugees work and live in the bloc- a divisive topic during the 2015 migrant crisis Brussels is buying and supplying weapons for the first time ever to a country at war The Energy Transition - so often put on a backburner by EU countries - promises to be a revolution with new plans to reduce heavy reliance on Russian gas EU outliers Poland and Hungary in Brussels bad books for years are back in the fold as a result of the current crisis Brussels cooperation and co-ordination with Nato and the US are smoother and closer than theyve been in a long time Is this a temporary blip or are we looking at a Brussels rebirth; an EU 2.0? The EU was already aware - certainly after the 2016 Brexit vote if not before - that it needed some serious self-improvement. The bloc was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize back in 2012 for over six decades contributing to the advancement of peace and reconciliation democracy and human rights in Europe. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption EU member states have sent defensive weapons to Ukraine but face demands for greater support But in the eyes of many Europeans Brussels became seen as a home for neo-liberalism rather than liberalism. A promoter of trade deals prioritising big business and a maker of dirty migrant deals (with Turkey for example) to keep refugees from reaching EU shores. A bloc that along with many national governments was perceived as helping banks instead of families after the 2008 economic crisis. An entity decades after the Second World War that had lost its vision mission and recognition as a force for peace in Europe. Populism nationalism and illiberalism became familiar faces in European politics as voters looked for a better fit. EU countries fell out over migration eurozone reform and more. Conspiracy theories flourished as trust in Brussels and traditional politicians waned. Strongman leaders like Hungary\s Viktor Orban Turkey\s Recep Erdogan America\s Donald Trump and Russia\s Vladimir Putin were increasingly admired. Then in 2020 the Covid pandemic prompted a reset. After an unedifying start Brussels was perceived as working in the public interest. Member states seemed more united opinion polls were approving. The EUs Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell has appealed to EU leaders to display the same drive and resolve shown in face of Covid when dealing with the Russia-Ukraine crisis and resulting challenges. This war on European soil has refocused EU minds as to what the bloc could - or should - stand for. Vladimir Putins assault on Ukraine is also seen by the EU majority as a geopolitical attack on European security as a whole. EPA The war in Ukraine is an immense trauma a human political humanitarian drama and its undoubtedly an element thatll lead to completely redefining the architecture of our Europe Emmanuel Macron French President But this two-day informal summit could well expose cracks in this new-found EU unity. All EU leaders fret about rising energy costs and the impact back home of Russia sanctions and possible counter sanctions. But they disagree on what to do about it. Some call for an EU-wide solution - that is new funds from Brussels. Others like Germany and the Netherlands say no. Emmanuel Macron is the host of the summit since France currently holds the rotating EU presidency. Hes long been a champion of a stronger more independent Europe weaning itself off food technology and energy imports and building up its own defence force to work alongside Nato. But the prospect of a European Army (under French command) remains an unlikely prospect. Instead EU countries will discuss better co-ordination and the pooling of military resources... while likely arguing over which nations should win the best contracts. Getty Images There is a war in Europe. My wish is for the EU to unleash its strength and continue to act in unity to ensure peace in Europe has a good perspective. That is what is at stake now Olaf Scholz (R) German Chancellor As for migration. two million Ukrainians have already fled the country. Depending on how long the misery and violence continue many more could arrive in the EU. Diplomats Ive spoken to predict that funding housing and relocating millions across different member states could yet prove difficult longer term.

Climate change: EU unveils plan to end reliance on Russian gas,The EU Commission outlines an ambitious roadmap to cut imports of Russian gas by two thirds in a year.,Climate change: EU unveils plan to end reliance on Russian gas By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Published 8 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE NATHAN STIRK As countries scramble to reduce their reliance on Russias oil and gas in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine few places are as exposed as the European Union. The EU gets roughly 40% of its gas from Russia: According to figures from research group Transport & Environment this dependence costs around $118m a day. But moving with a speed few thought possible the EU has now laid out a strategy that could cut reliance on this fuel source by two thirds within a year. The REPowerEU plan aims to make Europe independent of Russian fossil fuels by 2030 but the initial efforts focus solely on gas. The roadmap essentially proposes finding alternative supplies of gas in the next few months and boosting energy efficiency while doubling down on greener sources of power in the medium to longer term. It\s hard bloody hard said EU Commission vice president Frans Timmermans. But it\s possible if we\re willing to go further and faster than we\ve done before. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Part of the Yamal pipeline that brings gas from Russia to Europe The Commissions new proposals will make it a legal requirement for EU countries to ensure they have a minimum level of gas storage. The aim is to have gas stocks at 90% of capacity by the Autumn up from around 30% now. Discussions are ongoing with existing gas suppliers including Norway Algeria and Azerbaijan to boost flows. The plan envisages ending reliance on all Russian fossil fuels well before 2030. In the short term gas should be sourced from the US and Africa while some countries may need to use more coal in the months ahead. The EU also proposes a massive ramping up of renewables biogas and hydrogen. Unite against climate change - Ukraine scientist World warned of irreversible climate impacts While carbon emissions may rise in the short term the longer-term aim is a speedier transition to sustainable sources. Another key focus in the coming months will be increased imports of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) from suppliers including the US Qatar and Australia. But with Germany announcing plans for two new LNG terminals to increase supplies some experts are worried that this could increase longer term dependency on fossil fuels. I think we\re living in a tricky time that there\s so much political pressure to make these energy policy decisions said Prof Paula Kivimaa from the Finnish Environment Institute and the University of Sussex. But we also must look beyond the next couple of years. If Germany builds new LNG infrastructure there is a risk that it kind of locks it in for the foreseeable future. As well as diversifying gas supplies the Commission also believes the reliance on Russia will be eased as there are new renewable energy projects due to come online. The EU says that countries should look to use the revenues raised from the Emissions Trading Scheme which have almost doubled since 2020 to pay for these green energy sources. But in the next few months dirtier energy sources like coal may also be needed. There is some capacity from the power sector to generate more electricity with coal and biofuels and there\s also some new wind and solar products coming online said Carlos Torres Diaz head of gas and power markets research at analysts Rystad Energy. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Rooftop solar power could meet a quarter of EU electricity needs So this could be a way of reducing some of the gas consumption as the power sector is the largest consumer of gas. This could be done within this year. Frans Timmermans recognised that for some countries it might make sense to switch to coal in the short term but this could bring its own difficulties. Europe gets around 30% of its coal from Russia. Alternative supplies from countries like South Africa and Columbia are not easily obtained. Any switch to coal would also rapidly boost carbon emissions a trend thats already well underway. We\ve already seen the emissions from coal increase last year because of an increase of 18% in coal power generation said Carlos Torres Diaz. So if this continues during 2022 emissions will continue to rise because coal power generation has more or less twice as much emissions as gas generation. The Commission document also says that renewable energy projects must be fast tracked and says there is huge potential in domestic rooftop solar power. Up to a quarter of the blocs electricity consumption could be generated from panels on homes farms and commercial building the Commission says. To reduce reliance on natural gas from whatever source the Commission is also calling for a huge ramp up in biogas which is made from agricultural and food waste. With the extra investment in renewables this could also lead to a significant increase in green hydrogen which can be made from wind and solar power. The Commission is now calling for a quadrupling of hydrogen use by 2030.

There may well be some dissenting voices when EU leaders meet in Versailles later this week. They will all recognise that all these proposed changes will not come cheap. Campaigners say that Europes governments must ensure the very poorest are protected. In parallel with introducing sanctions a huge package of support must be deployed to ensure that they do not deepen Europe\s ongoing energy poverty crisis and that no one has to choose between heating and eating said Mike Davis from Global Witness who are calling for a full oil and gas embargo on Russia. The need for everyone to be able to afford to heat their home must come before worries about economic growth. The Commission will be encouraging countries to use a toolbox of measures to protect consumers including windfall taxes on the profits of energy companies. But while the poorest may receive some protection in the short term there will be added pain on the price front. I don\t see a simple way for to shield the consumers from the costs that all of this transition will imply said Carlos Torres Diaz from Rystad. Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.

NI Protocol: Edwin Poots wants EU pressed on seeds importation rules,The agriculture minster wants more cereals and potatoes grown locally in response to the Ukraine war.,NI Protocol: Edwin Poots wants EU pressed on seeds importation rules By John Campbell BBC News NI Economics & Business Editor Published 10 March Share Related Topics Brexit IMAGE SOURCE PHOTOATTRACTIVE Image caption Northern Irelands agriculture minister wants more wheat barley and potatoes grown locally Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots has asked the UK government to press the EU to relax rules on importing agriculture seeds to Northern Ireland. Mr Poots says he wants farmers to grow more cereal crops and potatoes in response to the Ukraine war. Ukraine and Russia are major exporters of basic foodstuffs and the war has hit crop production driving up prices. The seeds trade comes under the Northern Ireland Protocol and involves an onerous import process. Mr Poots told the BBC: We\re looking at a situation where we\re going to have a shortage of wheat and barley and that will lead to all sorts of problems. So I want to see more wheat barley and potatoes grown in NI. You\ve grace periods on quite a number of things. I want grace periods on seeds and plants products. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem UK and EU determined to find durable solutions The NI Protocol and its economic impact The Ulster Farmers Union (UFU) has previously complained that new inspection and certification processes were limiting the varieties of seed available from Great Britain. The organisation has also said it was becoming uneconomical to order smaller quantities of seeds. Under the protocol there is an outright prohibition on moving seed potatoes from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland produces relatively little cereal with agriculture more focused on livestock. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption The Republic of Ireland imports about 5.5m tonnes of grain a year equivalent to 60% of supply Official figures suggest that in 2020 only about 1% of farms in Northern Ireland were classified as being predominately cereal producers. The total output of field crops was estimated at £62m whereas livestock output was estimated at £1.8bn. Earlier this week Irelands minister for agriculture Charlie McConalogue had called on farmers to grow more cereal crops. Ireland imports about 5.5m tonnes of grain a year equivalent to 60% of supply. Minister McConalogue said it was fortunate that Ireland was still early in the planting season providing the opportunity to grow more grain. However farm organisations have been lukewarm on the proposal. Tim Cullinan president of the Irish Farmers\ Association said: It is far from certain that asking all farmers to plant crops is the best use of the resources that are likely to be available to us.]

Brexit: UK and EU 'still determined to find solutions to protocol',The joint committee met on Tuesday to discuss issues around the Northern Ireland Protocol.,Brexit: UK and EU still determined to find solutions to protocol By John Campbell BBC News NI Economics & Business Editor Published 8 March comments Comments Share Related Topics Brexit IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES The UK and EU said they remain determined to find durable solutions to the issues around the Northern Ireland Protocol. The two sides issued a joint statement after a meeting of senior officials. The negotiators met in a body known as the Specialised Committee. It deals with technical issues and can make recommendations to the lead negotiators UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commission Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič. The statement said: Both parties underlined their ongoing determination to ensure that outstanding issues in the context of the protocol are addressed and durable solutions are found as soon as possible for the benefit of people and businesses in Northern Ireland. In addition the EU and the UK reiterated the importance of further engagement with business groups civil society and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland and committed to further joint engagements. Officials representing the NI Executive attended the meeting as part of the UK delegation. IMAGE SOURCE JOHANNA GERON/REUTERS Image caption British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commissioner in charge of Brexit negotiations Maroš Šefčovič The protocol is the Brexit deal which prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EUs single market for goods. That also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK something the EU accepts is causing difficulties for many businesses. The EU has agreed in principle that GB goods which are going to stay in Northern Ireland should be subject to fewer checks and controls than those which are due to travel onwards to the Republic of Ireland and the wider EU. But there is still a big difference between the UK and EU about how that should be implemented and what should be considered a reasonable level of risk to the EU single market. The NI Protocol and its economic impact A simple guide to the Brexit border problem The joint committee previously met in late February. At that time Mrs Truss and Mr Šefčovič said they were determined that outstanding issues would be addressed. A senior EU official suggested that the talks would happen in a more discreet way in the run up to the Northern Ireland Assembly elections in May. It is not yet clear if or how the war in Ukraine will affect the negotiations. Mrs Truss and Mr Šefčovič have previously made a joint statement expressing a wish for a positive EU-UK relationship which would allow for co-operation on common global challenges. Last week Mrs Truss was a guest at an emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels alongside the US secretary of state and Canadas foreign minister. However EU and UK sources have both played down the prospect that the changed environment could unlock rapid progress.]
"UK owes EU money over customs fraud, court rules",European judges say the tax authorities did not collect correct taxes on imports of undervalued Chinese clothing.,UK owes EU money over customs fraud court rules Published 8 March Share IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS The UK faces making a potentially hefty payment to the EU after its top court ruled it did too little to prevent fraud on imports of Chinese clothing. European judges said HMRC failed to pass on the correct amount of tax revenue to the EU on imports between 2011 and 2017. The European Commission took legal action in 2018 arguing it was owed €2.7bn (£2.4bn). The UK government said it would respond to the judgement in due course. The UK was accused of taking inadequate steps to prevent fraud after it was warned about the problem by the EUs watchdog Olaf in 2017. EU member states had been warned by Olaf about the risk of undervalued clothing and footwear coming from China via shell companies. EU seeks £2.4bn customs duties from UK MEPs back probe on unpaid UK tariffs A quick guide to whats in the Brexit deal In a ruling on Tuesday the European Court of Justice (ECJ) upheld the commissions claim the UK had not paid the correct tax revenue to the EU. However it did not agree with how the commission calculated what exactly it is owed. The commission will now have to recalculate a final claim. EU members have to pass on a share of the taxes that they collect on imports to the commission as part of their contribution to the EU budget. The BBC has asked the commission for a comment. A UK government spokesperson said: Throughout we\ve made the case that we took reasonable and proportionate steps to tackle the fraud in question and that the Commission vastly overstated the size and severity of the alleged fraud. The UK has always and continues to take customs fraud very seriously and evolves its response as new threats emerge. The UK cut formal ties with the EU in January 2021 following an 11-month transition period after it officially left the bloc. However the ECJ retains the power to make rulings over cases relating to how the UK applied EU law before Brexit took place.]

Katya Adler Europe editor @BBCkatyaadler on Twitter Published 7 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline was an early casualty of Germanys change of heart over Russia You know that feeling when youre running downhill going so fast that you seem to lose control of your own feet? Thats where the EU appears to be at the moment. Crushing financial sanctions on Russia that hurt European business. Brussels purchasing and sending weapons to a non-EU country at war. Germany beefing up its military despite post-World War Two queasiness. Staunchly neutral Finland and Sweden thinking of joining Nato. The blocs asylum procedure pushed aside to accommodate fleeing Ukrainians in whats described as Europes biggest refugee crisis since 1945. Once dismissed as impossible - or at least hugely improbable - from one day to the next EU revolutions provoked by the Russia-Ukraine crisis have been happening thick and fast. The next seismic change bubbling in Brussels? A looming energy revolution provoked by a simple question: Whats the point of punitive financial sanctions if Vladimir Putins war chest is refilled on a daily basis with oil and gas revenues? The EU depends on Russia for 40% of its natural gas and a quarter of its oil imports. EU countries pay about €1bn a day to Moscow for those supplies according to Bruegel the Brussels-based think tank. The US - which is far less reliant on Russian energy supplies than Europe - says its considering banning Russian oil imports as part of its sanctions against the Kremlin. On Monday standing next to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken Lithuania\s foreign minister agreed. We cannot pay for oil and gas with Ukrainian blood he said. Price woes and the electorate Along with other eastern European Nato and EU members Lithuania views Vladimir Putin - with his ambitions to change Europes geopolitical order in Moscows favour - as an active security threat. The West must fight Russia with all means available said Lithuania\s president. To avoid World War Three. But other EU countries such as big powers Germany and Italy - far more reliant on Russian energy than most - feel more threatened by the prospect of skyrocketing energy prices that would surely follow any sanctions on Russian oil or gas imports. Energy prices are already painfully high across the continent. Until Russias attacks on Ukraine the majority of Germans supported Nord Stream 2 their new gas pipeline direct from Russia. The pipeline has been frozen as part of EU sanctions against Russia but Berlin fears public opinion could turn if Germans suddenly cant fill their cars with petrol or afford to heat their homes. Germanys Federation of Industries the BDI has warned that soaring prices could crush the EUs largest economy forcing factory and other German business closures with a rippling effect across the single market. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Anti-nuclear sentiment has always been strong in Germany Frances Emmanuel Macron is nervous too. He hopes to be re-elected president next month. The last time he was blamed for petrol price hikes in France it sparked months of massive street protests by the gilets jaunes the yellow jackets so-called because of the high-visibility vests they wore. So while on the world stage President Macron presents himself as the European champion of carbon neutrality energy prices are such a sensitive issue in France that he introduced €100 bonuses for the poorest voters this winter to mitigate fossil fuel prices as part of his re-election bid. Its notable too that French energy giant Total says its staying put in Russia for now despite the Kremlins onslaught against Ukraine while competitors BP and Shell have voluntarily pulled out. Ukraine needs EU action now So are energy sanctions against Russia just the latest example of an EU impossible that will suddenly become reality? The issue will be discussed in the European Parliament on Tuesday and among EU leaders at their Thursday summit. When I speak to EU naysayers they talk defensively not only about the dangers of domestic blowback but also potential aftershocks in the global energy market. At the moment we\re speaking with one voice alongside Latin America regarding Russian aggression one diplomat told me. But what would happen if the Argentine economy implodes as a result of energy price hikes and scarcity and the EU and the West is blamed for that? So for the moment the EU is clinging to what it views as safer ground. On Monday EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc would be speeding up efforts to wean itself off Russian energy. These include: finding reliable alternative suppliers (such as Qatar and Azerbaijan) improving energy efficiency eg renovating buildings and using artificial intelligence to effectively manage the energy grid massive investment in renewables such as solar wind and hydrogen already planned under the European Green Deal. Russias actions in Ukraine mean Brussels now views the Climate Question as a question of security. Energy security. Germanys new chancellor took the worlds breath away a week ago by reversing his countrys defence policy sending weapons to Ukraine and announcing a €100bn investment in the German military. His finance minister has also announced a €200bn investment in renewable and alternative energy sources. Germanys need is acute as it has all but phased out nuclear energy as well as phasing out coal. But those plans for renewable energies alternative suppliers and a clean energy divorce from Russia will take time. Something Ukraine just does not have.

Ukraine invasion: EU shuts airspace to Russian planes,"Russian planes will now be unable to land in, take off from or fly over any EU nation.",Ukraine invasion: EU shuts airspace to Russian planes Published 27 February Share The EU has imposed a blanket flight ban on Russian planes the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has announced. We are shutting down EU airspace for Russian-owned Russian-registered or Russian-controlled aircraft she said. All such planes including the private jets of oligarchs will now be unable to land in take off from or fly over any EU nation. Russian planes have also been banned from UK airspace. Russias biggest airline Aeroflot said it would cancel all flights to European destinations until further notice in a retaliatory move on Sunday. Ahead of the decision European countries had been closing their airspace one by one. Germany said its ban would last three months. Departure boards at Moscows Domodedovo and Sheremetyevo airports showed dozens of cancellations on Sunday including flights to Paris Vienna and Kaliningrad. Russias S7 Airlines said on Facebook it would cancel flights to many of its European destinations until at least 13 March. Russia has been responding with tit-for-tat restrictions on countries banning its flights. The Commission president said that the EU was also going to ban Russia\s state-owned news outlets Sputnik and Russia Today widely seen as a mouthpiece for the Kremlin. We are developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe she said. Is Russias invasion going as expected? Zelensky: A president rising to the moment Miles of queues at borders to flee invasion The restrictions on flights will require Russian airlines to take circuitous routes resulting in longer flight times. Commercial airlines are also avoiding airspace around Ukraine Moldova and Belarus following Russias invasion. In the US Delta Air Lines said it would suspend a flight booking agreement with Russias Aeroflot. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption All Russian-registered planes will be affected by the flight ban The UKs ban on Russian flights led Moscow to retaliate with a similar curb on British planes. Virgin Atlantic said avoiding Russia would add between 15 minutes and an hour to its flights between the UK and India and Pakistan. Australian airline Qantas said it would use a longer route for its direct flight between Darwin and London that does not overfly Russia.

"Ukraine war: Europe's new security era, faced with Russian threat","Many commentators say Ukraine's war has united Europe as hasn't been seen in years, but are they right?",Ukraine war: Europes new security era faced with Russian threat Katya Adler Europe editor @BBCkatyaadler on Twitter Published 11 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption A banner of Russian President Vladimir Putin next to the Moscow embassy in Riga Latvia Era defining new reality historic moment - that\s where we are right now in Europe. At least that\s what countless European politicians and commentators say since Russian President Vladimir Putin began his invasion of Ukraine. Are they right? Yes and No Id argue. Starting with the Yes. On 24 February President Putin shocked this continent out of complacency. His assault on Ukraine has brought large-scale death and destruction back to Europe including whispers of possible nuclear war. His aim: not only to dominate Ukraine but to roll back Western dominance militarily and - ideally - politically in terms of liberal democracy from the former Soviet sphere of influence. The action Western allies take together now will fundamentally affect Europeans sense of self and safety for years to come. Nato is re-invigorated. The transatlantic military alliance once dismissed by French President Emmanuel Macron as brain dead is simultaneously proving Mr Putin wrong to view the West as weak and disunited while also providing military support defence and deterrence to Nato\s eastern flank that feels so exposed to the Kremlin\s expansionist fervour. This - so far - is also proving to be a defining moment for the EU. The bloc had long talked up playing a bigger role on the world stage - and not solely in terms of economics and trade. Until now that was a failed ambition. But the Russia-Ukraine crisis has unexpectedly elevated the EU into a credible geopolitical player. The speed with which Brussels co-ordinated sanctions against Russia - both within the EU and with international allies - was frankly impressive. As were the unity of resolve amongst member states and the bureaucracy-defying EU moves to enact never-before-used mechanisms to help Ukrainian refugees and the Ukrainian military. Germany one of the EUs biggest players also took the worlds breath away by suddenly saying goodbye to World War Two sensitivities and announcing huge investments in its military the Bundeswehr. Key to the decision being applauded in the EU and further afield is that this is not a Germany newly flexing nationalist muscles. This is about Germany helping to re-define Europe not its own role Ricarda Lang told me. She is the co-chair of the German Green Party in the coalition government. It\s about European sovereignty not just in security and defence but also in terms of imports and energy. For years Germany has knowingly been reliant on the US for security and on Russia for energy and trade. It is not the only EU country in that position. But as the blocs richest and most powerful nation Berlin is the most stand-out example. And this has weakened the Wests hand when it comes to sanctions against Russia. EU countries pay Moscow up to €800m (£674m; $884m) for energy every day which amounts to an estimated 40% of the Kremlins income. This money goes towards funding the war against Ukraine that the West is ostensibly fighting. It\s tragic it took a war like this but now we Germans have woken up with a bang! insists Marie Agnes Strack-Zimmerman who heads the German parliament\s Defence Committee. She assured me Berlin was now ready to take responsibility. Image caption We Germans have woken up with a bang! said the chairwoman of the German parliaments Defence Committee The West looked at Germany with suspicion after two world wars she observed but that was decades ago and - to be honest she said - Germany was pretty comfortable enjoying being a Nato and EU member without having to invest in its own army. Germany\s allies have waited too long for us to do our bit. Berlin has now pledged to build an efficient modern military and to keep up defence spending to Nato requirements. Under international pressure trade and energy ties are being tackled too. Bear in mind though that transforming the currently threadbare German military will take years as will untangling the country from its deep-seated relations with Russia. For decades Berlin was the dividing line between East and West Europe. Hopes for European unity were high after the fall of the iconic Berlin Wall and the ensuing 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union. But fast-forward 30 years and you hear talk of a new Berlin Wall though further to the east. Tiny Baltic country Latvia has a 200km (124 mile)-long border fence separating the EU and Nato member on one side from expansionist Russia on the other. Col Sandris Gaugers is the commander of the Latvian Land Forces Mechanized Infantry Brigade. We spoke at his military base just outside the capital Riga. The base is also home to Nato forces which have almost doubled in size since Russia invaded Ukraine. Image caption Col Sandris Gaugers said priorities have changed across Europe I see a new Iron Curtain coming. Though this time we\ll be on the western side the colonel told me. We are living a new reality. For us Latvians the security environment is now gone. We spent 20 years in Iraq in Afghanistan. Now our main focus is here. How do we defend our freedom and our country? Priorities have now changed across Europe he said. People used to focus on economic wealth. Now it\s about defending our values and way of life. Latvians and their Baltic neighbours in Estonia and Lithuania are trying hard not to say I-told-you-so to the West. They\ve been warning about President Putin for years. They feel they understand the Russian leader better than most. All three countries were once part of the Soviet Union. Latvia\s Prime Minister Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš insists the West has to accept that Putin is not like us. France and German leaders famously went on diplomatic visits to Moscow earlier this year trying to dissuade President Putin from attacking Ukraine. Prime Minister Kariņš says agonising over finding the right words or turns of phrase to persuade Mr Putin is pointless. He\s hell-bent on destroying democracy and our way of life. If we don\t stop Putin. He will not stop at Ukraine. Mr Kariņš said the one good thing to come out of the current situation is that Nato and the EU are working closer together than they have in 30 years. That he said was a game-changer. And here we come back to whether this is an era-defining moment for Europe. Or maybe not. The EU is thrilled to have the US back and engaged in Europe. For all Brussels\ talk of the bloc now building strategic sovereignty in defence and security EU countries look to Washington when faced with Russian threats. Image caption Training session at the Adazi military base in Latvia EU defence plans designed to complement - or to partly replace - Nato depending which European politician you speak to are nothing new. And so far theyve never worked. All EU countries agree that at the very least it makes sense to pool resources and know-how: cyber military equipment and intelligence. Yet no nation wants to go first. Each EU member has businesses or individuals benefiting from national contracts. The European Commission now wants to oversee the overhaul of defence capabilities. Few in the military are holding their breath wherever they reside in Europe. As regards the renaissance in EU-Nato co-operation in all likelihood once the acute Russia-Ukraine crisis subsides the US will turn its attention to what it truly sees as its foreign policy priority: the Asia-Pacific not Europe. But the EU has its raison dêtre back. Designed originally as a peace project its vision fell by the wayside in recent times. Younger Europeans had no memory of war. They saw no urgency in uniting or fighting for peace on their continent. In that regard this moment really is a new reality. Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Nato Vladimir Putin European Union]

From what I heard went on behind closed doors he wasnt wrong. Russias actions in Ukraine impact many EU members directly. It feels personal to them. Their belief: that Vladimir Putin has his eye on much more than Ukraine - that he wants to redesign the security architecture of Europe in his favour. Countries in central and eastern Europe which used to be behind the Iron Curtain - now EU and Nato members - feel very exposed. Particularly the Baltic States which border Russia. They fear the Kremlin intends to destabilise them with cyber attacks and more disinformation campaigns aimed at their ethnic Russian communities. Russia attacks Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS: Why is Putin invading Ukraine? FROM KYIV: BBC Ukraine editor: There is no safe place any more FROM MOSCOW: Shock and support in Russian capital IN MAPS: How Russia carried out the invasion On his way into Thursday nights summit the Polish prime minister voiced deep frustration that tougher sanctions hadnt been imposed earlier on Moscow. Enough of this cheap talking snapped Mateusz Morawiecki. Europe continues buying so much Russian oil and gas he said. And he Vladimir Putin] is turning it into aggression invasion. He\s destabilising all of Europe. But other EU leaders pulled in a different direction. True all 27 of them unanimously agreed to an unprecedented sanctions package described by the European Council president as massive and painful against Russia. The package targets more sectors of the Russian economy including the transport and energy sectors (with a ban on exports from Europe that Russia depends on to refine its oil for sale) as well as the financial sector and more individuals close to the Kremlin. EU leaders also agreed to slap sanctions on Belarus a key Putin ally. But the sanctions and counter-sanctions threatened by Russia will hit European economies too. Some more than others making them wary. Germany and Italy - so reliant on Russian gas supplies and business ties - urged the EU to hold back on the toughest sanctions of all for now like limiting oil and gas imports and ejecting Russia from the Swift international payment system. Berlin and Rome argue it\s wiser to keep those nuclear measures as they\re known up the EU\s sleeve in case the situation worsens in Ukraine. Their critics accuse them of self-interest in a time of international crisis. Emotional but dignified Hungary Romania and Poland meanwhile voiced other concerns at the summit. Direct neighbours of Ukraine they worry theyll find themselves on the front line of a new migration crisis should Ukrainians try to flee the hostilities in large numbers. Brussels says its working both on contingency plans to help refugees and to compensate EU countries worst hit by sanctions and resulting further spiralling energy prices. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption People arriving from Kyiv sheltered inside a railway station in Poland on Thursday The message the EU hoped to transmit on Thursday was one of unity: externally with warnings to Russia and assurances of solidarity to Ukraine. EU leaders heard what\s described as an emotional but dignified address by Ukraine\s president via video conference. But also internally - to show all member states that theyre in this crisis together. For the long haul. Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Russia Vladimir Putin European Union Ukraine]

Iona Popescu of environmental NGO the Environmental Coalition on Standards said the rules were designed to bring in longer-lasting products that could be used multiple times rather than worn a few times then thrown away. The Commission seeks to put a halt on fast fashion by introducing rules on textiles to be used in the European market she said. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption The global fashion industry is estimated to have produced around 2.1 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2018 Its estimated that less than 1% of all clothing worldwide is recycled. What is fast fashion? Can sustainable fashion turn the red carpet green? Could ditching fast fashion make us happier? According to the European Environment Agency clothes use in Europe has on average the fourth highest impact on the environment and climate exceeded only by food housing and transport. For every person in the EU textile consumption requires nine cubic metres of water 400 square metres of land 391kg of raw materials and causes a carbon footprint of about 270kg. In the UK politicians have called on the government to change the law to require fashion retailers to comply with environmental standards. The government rejected most of the Environmental Audit Committees recommendations in 2019 including making clothes producers pay for better clothing collection and recycling but has made textile waste a priority. Tamara Cincik of the think tank for the fashion industry Fashion Roundtable said the textiles strategy could set the tone for future legislation outside of the EU. If expectations of brands in the UK compared to the EU diverge this will hopefully encourage stronger expectations of future UK legislation she said. This is why it is so important for both UK brands and the government to be alert to this strategy as the EU remains our largest and indeed closest trading partner for the textiles and fashion industry. The proposals will now be discussed by the Council and European Parliament.

Ukraine: EU deploys cyber rapid-response team,"Cyber-security experts from six countries are deployed, after Ukraine calls for help in defence against Russia.",Ukraine: EU deploys cyber rapid-response team By Joe Tidy Cyber reporter Published 22 February Share IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES A cyber rapid-response team (CRRT) is being deployed across Europe after a call for help from Ukraine. The newly formed team of eight to 12 experts from Lithuania Croatia Poland Estonia Romania and the Netherlands has committed to help defend Ukraine from cyber-attacks - remotely and on site in the country. An official warned attacks were likely. We can see that cyber-measures are an important part of Russia\s hybrid toolkit the CRRT official said. It comes after the UK and the US blamed Russia for cyber-attacks earlier this month that temporarily took a small number of Ukrainian banking and government websites offline. Why is Putin ordering troops into Ukraine? UK warned to bolster defences against cyber attacks EU wants emergency team for cyber-attacks The Lithuanian Ministry of Defence tweeted: In response to Ukraine request we] are activating a] Lithuanian-led cyber rapid-response team which will help Ukrainian institutions to cope with growing cyber-threats. #StandWithUkraine. CRRTs are a European Union initiative to deepen defence and co-operation between member states. They are said to be equipped with commonly developed cyber-toolkits designed to detect recognise and mitigate cyber-threats. An official said the team was composed of different cyber-expertise such as incident response forensics vulnerability assessment to be able to react to a variety of scenarios. Russia has previously been accused of so-called hybrid warfare combining cyber-attacks with traditional military activity in Georgia and Crimea. Media caption Experts have been warning for years it is a matter of when - rather than if - hackers will kill somebody The EU and Ukraine blamed Russia after thousands of people in multiple cities in Ukraine experienced power cuts in 2015 and 2016 when hackers temporarily shut off electricity substations. The US UK and EU also blamed it for the hugely disruptive NotPetya wiper attack. Experts say about 2000 NotPetya attacks were launched in 2017 mainly aimed at Ukraine but the malicious software spread globally causing billions of dollars of damage to computer systems across Europe Asia and the Americas. Moscow denies being behind the attack calling such claims Russophobic. Related Topics Computer hacking Russia Cyber-attacks Ukraine]

Brexit: UK and EU will find 'durable' solutions to protocol,"Officials say there is a determination that outstanding issues are addressed and ""solutions found"".",Brexit: UK and EU will find durable solutions to protocol By John Campbell BBC News NI Economics & Business Editor Published 21 February comments Comments Share Related Topics EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks IMAGE SOURCE JOHANNA GERON/REUTERS Image caption British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commissioner in charge of Brexit negotiations Maroš Šefčovič pose for a photograph in Brussels Negotiations on the Northern Ireland Protocol will continue the EU and UKs lead negotiators have said. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commission Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič released a joint statement after Mondays talks in Brussels. They said there is a determination that outstanding issues are addressed. They are keen that durable solutions are found for the benefit of citizens businesses and stability in NI. Their officials have been engaged in technical talks since October. A senior EU official has suggested that the talks will happen in a more discreet way due to the forthcoming Northern Ireland elections. They said it could mean less regular formal political meetings which create a bit of expectation or excitement. IMAGE SOURCE JOHANNA GERON/REUTERS Image caption Maroš Šefčovič speaks during a news conference after a meeting the UK foreign secretary The statement from Mrs Truss and Mr Šefčovič noted that: The joint bodies established by the Withdrawal Agreement should meet regularly and agreed to discuss any point raised by the EU or the UK that is of relevance to the Withdrawal Agreement in general. The protocol is the Brexit deal which prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EUs single market for goods. That also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? The EU accepts that is causing difficulties for businesses and in October proposed a package of measures to reduce its practical impacts. In December it published further proposals aimed at guaranteeing the supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The UK wants more far-reaching changes to the protocols operation and governance. The EU official said that the technical talks had made some progress in trying to find ways to reduce the burden of customs paperwork on Northern Ireland businesses. The EU believes it will be possible to reduce the data fields on customs declarations from 80 to 30. The UK believes that the reduction should be greater with traders only needing to use customs codes which would describe goods in high level terms. But the EU says that for the purposes of risk management they need customs codes which give a greater level of detail. The example they give is olive oil - some types of olive oil like extra virgin are clearly for consumption in restaurants or supermarkets. IMAGE SOURCE HENRY NICHOLLS Image caption Liz Truss says a solution must be found to allow focus on external issues like the situation in Eastern Europe But other grades of olive oil are used for food processing - the EU believes a risk assessment needs to be able to draw that distinction which is why they want more detailed codes. There has also been progress on access to UK customs databases - long requested by the EU; their experts have got access and are beginning to understand how they might extract the data they need. However there appears to have been little progress on the issue of agri-food checks on goods moving from GB to NI. Asked if the UK would trigger Article 16 which allows either side to unilaterally decide whether to stop implementing parts of the trade deal Mrs Truss said that she wanted to improve the situation through talks. Article 16 is in the Protocol as a safeguard if things aren\t working as they should she said after the talks. Laser focus Mr Sefcovic told a news conference in Brussels that the intensified negotiations on the protocol had produced neither a breakthrough nor a breakdown. He said hard work would continue with a laser focus on practical solutions. My objective remains the same - to provide Northern Ireland and all stakeholders on the ground with stability predictability and opportunities stemming from the protocol he said. Ultimately this is the only way to protect the hard-earned gains of the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement in all its dimensions while avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland and minimising disruptions caused by Brexit without compromising the integrity of the EU\s single market he added. Northern Irelands first and deputy first ministers normally attend the Joint Committee but those positions are vacant since the Democratic Unionist Partys (DUP) Paul Givan stepped down from the first ministers post. He resigned as part of the DUPs campaign of opposition to the protocol. Sinn Féin Junior Minister Declan Kearney did attend in their absence. Meanwhile the Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi was asked on Monday about the possibility of any future trade deals between the UK and the United States. Ms Pelosi said: Our relationship in trade is dependent on how the Brexit accords are resolved. She added she wanted to see the Good Friday accords honoured and for the] border to remain the way it is. She said she had told Boris Johnson months ago not to expect a bilateral trade agreement with the US if there is an unravelling of the Good Friday accords in relationship to the border.]

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Justin Lee Price sent a clearly racist tweet to the Manchester United player after the loss in July 2021. The 19-year-old\s actions constituted a hate crime a CPS spokesman said. Price of Grandison Gardens Worcester was jailed for six weeks at Kidderminster Magistrates Court. He previously admitted one count of sending a grossly offensive message by a public communication network at a hearing on 17 March. Ruin the game The CPS said Price initially tried to avoid detection by changing his Twitter username after the post was reported. He then denied the offence in his first police interview following his arrest but later admitted posting the tweet when he was questioned by officers a second time. The spokesman said the tweet which included Rashford\s username saw Price swear use a racist slur and claim that his dead nan could have scored that. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Bukayo Saka who missed Englands last penalty also faced abuse online after the final Rashford and fellow players Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were targeted with abuse online in the aftermath of the final. A mural honouring Rashford was also defaced in Manchester before being repainted and covered with messages of hope and support. Speaking after sentencing senior crown prosecutor Mark Johnson said Price had targeted Rashford based on the colour of his skin and his action was clearly racist and a hate crime. Those who racially abuse footballers ruin the game for all he said. I hope this case sends out the message that we will not tolerate racism and offenders will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

Brexit: UK and EU to continue 'intensive' NI protocol talks,"The UK and EU agree on the ""need for progress in the interest of people in Northern Ireland"".",Brexit: UK and EU to continue intensive NI protocol talks By Jayne McCormack BBC News NI political correspondent Published 11 February comments Comments Share Related Topics EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks IMAGE SOURCE SIMON DAWSON / NO10 DOWNING STRE Image caption Liz Truss and Maroš Šefčovič met at Carlton Gardens in London on Friday The UK and EU will hold intensive discussions in the coming days after another round of negotiations between Liz Truss and her EU counterpart Maroš Šefčovič came to an end on Friday. The chief Brexit negotiator previously said fixing the Northern Ireland Protocol was an absolute priority. A joint statement indicated the pair had agreed on the need for progress in the interest of people in NI. They said they will keep in close touch. The UK foreign secretary and EU Commission vice president spoke via video-conference last week but no breakthrough was reached. A meeting of the Joint Committee the formal body overseeing the protocol will happen on 21 February. That will be the first such meeting of the committee in more than six months. The government has insisted it wants to reach a solution urgently after the collapse of the power-sharing executive at Stormont last week. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) withdrew Paul Givan as first minister as part of its ongoing opposition to the Irish Sea border. The party has argued that unless the arrangements are changed political institutions in Northern Ireland cannot continue as normal. Image caption Liz Truss said she wants to work with the EU towards solutions that deliver for people in Northern Ireland Ahead of the meeting Ms Truss said: Fixing the Northern Ireland Protocol is an absolute priority for me. We have a shared responsibility with the EU to work towards solutions as quickly as possible that deliver for the people of Northern Ireland. The protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EUs single market for goods and EU customs rules are enforced at its ports. That arrangement has prevented a hardening of the Irish land border but it means new paperwork and processes when importing goods from Great Britain. Unionist politicians have criticised the arrangements and say the Irish Sea border undermines Northern Irelands position in the UK as well as causing difficulties for some businesses. It is slow-going The fact that a statement is joint would usually be taken as a good sign. But todays readout from the UKs Liz Truss and the EUs Maroš Šefčovič was also very brief - with a good chunk of the word count used up describing the logistics of the meeting rather than its actual substance. Rumours that the UK would use today to make a big new offer have been downplayed by both sides although I am told ideas are always being batted about. Customs is the area where there has been the most progress but it is slow-going. All eyes now turn to the joint committee on 21 February - where senior politicians and representatives will meet in Brussels. It is a moment to take stock and see what if anything can be formally agreed in this period of heightened political sensitivity in Northern Ireland ahead of the assembly elections in May. Greatest threat Speaking after an anti-protocol rally in Dromore County Down on Thursday night DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said it was the single greatest threat to Northern Ireland\s place in the UK in a generation. The presence of trade barriers within our own country has the grave potential to succeed where decades of terrorism failed by driving an irrevocable wedge between Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK Sir Jeffrey said. IMAGE SOURCE PACEMAKER PRESS Image caption Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the EU should act immediately to resolve the problems created by the protocol If the EU really care about political stability in Northern Ireland then they should act immediately to resolve the problems created by the protocol. The rally also featured TUV leader Jim Allister and Ulster Unionist assembly member Robbie Butler alongside Baroness Kate Hoey and former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib. On Thursday former prime minister John Major described the protocol as arguably one of the worst pieces of negotiation we have seen in recent history. It is causing an enormous amount of trouble he said. Whether anyone deliberately misled about that I can\t say - certainly they were mistaken. But it does help if you sign treaties if you understand them before you sign them. IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption Former prime minister John Major described the protocol as arguably one of the worst pieces of negotiation we have seen in recent history On Wednesday Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated his view that the government would trigger a mechanism to override part of the deal if a breakthrough cannot be reached. Article 16 allows either the UK or EU to temporarily suspend the protocol if it is deemed to be causing significant economic societal or environmental difficulties. Givan resignation triggers fresh political crisis Executive return difficult if protocol remains A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Over the past seven months the UK government has been attempting to renegotiate the deal. In July it proposed an arrangement in which goods from Great Britain which are due to stay in Northern Ireland would not be checked and would have minimal paperwork. Goods which are due to move onwards to the Republic of Ireland would be checked at Northern Irelands ports. The EU published its own proposals in October which it said would significantly reduce but not eliminate checks on goods. It has previously said that the easiest way to reduce checks would be for the UK to sign up to a Swiss-style agri-food agreement. That would involve all of the UK following the relevant EU rules something the government has said it could not accept.]

Climate change: EU moves to label nuclear and gas as sustainable despite internal row,"A highly controversial decision to class nuclear and gas power as ""green"" splits EU members.",Climate change: EU moves to label nuclear and gas as sustainable despite internal row Published 2 February Share Related Topics Climate change IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Only some EU members use nuclear power - others are fiercely opposed Nuclear and natural gas energy plants could be counted as green energy under controversial EU plans just unveiled. The European Commission says it has decided that both types of energy can classify as sustainable investment if they meet certain targets. But the move has divided the EU and been fiercely opposed by some members. Austria\s chancellor responded to the news by saying nuclear power is neither green nor sustainable. I cannot understand the decision of the EU Karl Nehammer said. He said he would back his environment minister Leonore Gewessler in pursuing legal action at the European Court of Justice if the plans go ahead. This decision is wrong Ms Gewessler said. The EU Commission today agreed its greenwashing programme for nuclear energy and the fossil fuel] natural gas. Luxembourg has also said it will join in legal action. The EU has set itself a goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050 and the Commission argues that to get there a great deal of private investment is needed. Its proposals are meant to guide investors. 🇱🇺 strongly reaffirms its opposition to the inclusion of #nuclear & fossil #gas in the decision on #EUTaxonomy for sustainable finance of the @EUCommission. We will consider further legal steps together with 🇦🇹. @TimmermansEU @McGuinnessEU @KadriSimson @DieschbourgC @MinFinLux — Claude Turmes (@ClaudeTurmes) February 2 2022 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter Spain too has strongly objected to the idea which was debated for months before being formally proposed on Wednesday. But those objections are balanced by support from nuclear-using nations such as France. Nuclear energy involves fewer carbon emissions but has different safety concerns and requires disposal of dangerous waste. Classifying natural gas as sustainable also has supporters who argue that some countries which still rely on coal for energy - such as Poland - would benefit from incentives to move to a relatively cleaner supply. Germany a powerful country in EU politics relies heavily on gas in its own energy mix though its environment minister Steffi Lemke has criticised the plans. Battle ahead EU officials were keen to stress that the change was not a requirement for any state or company to invest in gas or nuclear. It is instead a highly technical set of rules called the EU Taxonomy about what classifies as sustainable so that private investors can decide where to put funds the commission says. It also regulates what can be said to be environmentally friendly so that climate-conscious investors can make informed decisions. The list is supposed to recognise green projects that make a substantial contribution to at least one of the EU\s environmental goals while not significantly harming any of them. A really simple guide to climate change Greenhouse gas build-up hit new high in 2020 Fossil fuel production set to soar in next decade Commission officials point to the strict limits on what qualifies. For example natural gas generation is under a strict CO2 emissions limit and a requirement to switch to low-carbon gas by 2035. Nuclear power meanwhile must be in countries with clear plans and funding for dealing with nuclear waste. Critics however have accused the EU of so-called greenwashing - precisely what it says its classification system is supposed to avoid. But the decision to label both controversial industries as green is not yet final. In addition to the threat of legal action from Austria and Luxembourg the European Parliament and the council of heads of state have four months to consider the suggestion and object to it. IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption Commissioner Mairead McGuinness argues that every tool to reach climate targets must be used The bar is however relatively high. In order to block the commissions proposed plans either a majority of parliament members or at least 20 of the 27 national leaders are needed. Green parties which together with independents and others form one of the main power blocs in the European Parliament are fiercely campaigning against the plan. But European Commissioner Mairead McGuinness said we need to use all the tools at our disposal to reach the climate-neutral target. Private investment was key she said and the proposals were setting out strict conditions to help mobilise finance to support this transition away from more harmful energy sources like coal.

The heavy losses of an elite Russian regiment in Ukraine,"The 331st Guards Parachute Regiment based in Kostroma, Russia, has lost many soldiers in Ukraine.",The heavy losses of an elite Russian regiment in Ukraine By Mark Urban Diplomatic and defence editor Newsnight Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption Some of the 39 Russian soldiers from the 331st regiment who are known to have died In any war there are units that distinguish themselves and others that become symbolic of failure. The 331st Guards Parachute Regiment had high hopes of being the first but now represents the disintegration of Russias plan for a quick war. The regiment\s commanding officer Col Sergei Sukharev was killed in Ukraine on 13 March and was posthumously awarded the Hero of the Russian Federation medal. At his funeral deputy defence minister Gen Yuri Sadovenko said the colonel lived for the future for the future of our people a future without Nazism. IMAGE SOURCE GTRK-KOSTROMA Image caption Col Sergei Sukharev commander of the Kostroma 331st regiment was also killed Casualties among Russian forces are not widely reported in Russia itself but using open source material the BBC has pieced together the story of their advance and found that at least 39 other members of the elite 331st regiment have died. The men were part of a column that advanced into Ukraine from Belarus led by Russias airborne forces known by the acronym VDV. Their presence underlined the priority of their objective - advancing on the capital Kyiv. That advance swiftly got drawn into a destructive stalemate in districts on the outskirts of Kyiv which soon became synonymous with the viciousness of the war: Bucha Irpin and Hostomel. Videos that emerged online from these battles showed combat vehicles used by Russian airborne forces with V signs painted onto them. IMAGE SOURCE TWITTER One video we found shows several damaged light armoured vehicles from the VDV abandoned after an attack by Ukrainian special forces. Another shows several vehicles from the Russian airborne forces apparently abandoned. The men in the 331st regarded themselves as the pick of Russia\s army. In a video posted online last May a general tells soldiers of the 331st Parachute Regiment that they are the best of the best. The unit served in the Balkans Chechnya and the 2014 Russian intervention in the Donbas region of Ukraine and regularly took part in Red Square parades in Moscow. The 331st was also a showcase for Russias policy of replacing national service soldiers with contraktniki - professionals under contract. It is understandable why the generals should have given it an important role in the invasion.

RIP - this post is no longer public From early March reports began to circulate of deaths in the 331st. It took time for bodies to be returned to Kostroma the community where it is based 300km north-east of Moscow. As the funerals started an anguished conversation began playing out on social media. Memorial walls on V\Kontakte - the Russian equivalent of Facebook - pledge eternal memory and feature pictures of candles.

Now you are in heaven and you will protect us from there! You will always live in our hearts and you will forever be a real hero to me! Although many posts appear to accept Kremlin explanations that the war is being waged against Ukrainian fascists some also display anxiety about the lack of reliable information. IMAGE SOURCE VK.COM Image caption A post mourning Sergey Duganov On the memorial wall for Sergeant Sergei Duganov one woman wrote: Nobody knows anything. The 331st regiment is disappearing. Almost every day photos of our Kostroma boys get published. It sends shivers down my spine. What\s happening? When will this end? When will people stop dying? Her post was followed by another which exclaimed: Kostroma has lost so many young men what a tragedy. Another pleaded: God how many more death notifications shall we receive? Please have mercy on our boys help them survive return them back home to their wives and mothers. I\m begging you! IMAGE SOURCE VK.COM Image caption Yanosh Leonovs partner writes: You are a real hero you are the best father a loved and loving husband a loyal friend and a real fighter. Speaking out about the war in Russia carries great risks but there are hints of a loss of faith in the Kremlin\s arguments for war. On the memorial page for one sergeant a woman asks: Why aren\t children of MPs not on the frontline? The majority of them live in Europe anyway. Ordinary boys are dying for no good reason. Another uses an expletive to describe President Vladimir Putin and goes on to say that by deciding to play war he has sent thousands of guys to die. For the most part though those reacting on social media remain true to the official narrative. IMAGE SOURCE INSTAGRAM Image caption The top Ukrainian comment on a post mourning Ravshan Zhakbayev reads: Everyone who steps on our soil to occupy it will get buried in it. Welcome to hell! A later comment reads: Eternal memory to you our hero our protector. Thanks for all.((( On some V\Kontakte memorial walls Ukrainians have posted comments mocking the dead men. Over 15000 have died already and they will continue on dying as long as they\ll keep on marching on our land. Nobody invited you freaking saviours reads one. Alexander go away you bloody Nazi a Russian responds to another mocking post. Our soldiers are real heroes. Russians have never killed civilians nor children which is something you can\t say about Ukrainians. The fury of those online exchanges is nothing though to the experiences of the VDV forces who have been hit by Ukrainian artillery ambushes and infantry assaults during weeks of bloody combat. In these close-quarter battles they have discovered what earlier VDV units learned in Afghanistan - that armoured vehicles designed to be light enough to be carried on planes do not give much protection from enemy fire. From the roads outside Hostomel airfield to a side street in Bucha or a road junction in Irpin videos taken by Ukrainians have shown burnt out and abandoned vehicles belonging to the airborne group.

View original tweet on Twitter These scraps of phone footage also speak to a more basic failure. In these shattered neighbourhoods around Kyiv the Russian paratroopers were outmatched by the Ukrainians. And given that the defenders were in many cases simply local defence units or reservists that speaks to a basic failure in the VDVs system of training and recruitment. Ukrainians have latched on to the 331st\s losses making excited claims that the regiment has been wiped out. Ilya Ponamarev a former Russian MP and opposition figure who now lives in Kyiv says people there see the regiment\s fate as a perfect example of karma. During the 2014 fighting in the Donbas the 331st was held responsible by Ukrainians for killing hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers at Ilovaisk in breach of a ceasefire agreement. However while the regiment has suffered considerably Ukrainian claims that they have been wiped out are an exaggeration. It is likely though that the 331st Parachute Regiment may have been withdrawn from Ukraine recently - certainly unidentified elements of the VDV task force to which it belonged were filmed on 29 March pulling back into Belarus. Image caption Photographs of some of the Russian soldiers from the 331 regiment who have died As for the price of failure it mounts daily. At the time of writing BBC Newsnight had compiled a list of 39 named members of the 331st Parachute Regiment killed in Ukraine. But since none of those fatalities is more recent than the 13 March it can be supposed that dozens more will emerge in the coming weeks. Kostroma locals have told us they believe that around 100 members of the regiment may have died. And many families will never receive their loved ones body because it was left behind on the battlefield. Even a conservative projection of the deaths we now know about and their dates suggest that the towns losses in a few weeks in Ukraine already exceed those from the conflicts in Afghanistan and Chechnya. The regiment that set off full of confidence in February has acquired the type of reputation that no soldiers would ever want.

Ukraine round-up: Possible war crimes and an attack on Russia,"Day 37 saw Russia accuse Ukraine of bombing an oil facility on its territory, and the BBC witnessed possible evidence of war crimes.",Ukraine round-up: Possible war crimes and an attack on Russia Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Media caption Watch: Jeremy Bowen finds bodies on a road Russians occupied outside Kyiv As Russia pulls its forces back from areas around Ukraines capital Kyiv the BBC has seen evidence of potential war crimes on the outskirts of the city. Our correspondent Jeremy Bowen counted 13 bodies on one small stretch of highway where just hours earlier Russian forces had been in control. We know who two of the dead were: a Ukrainian father and mother who had been fleeing to the capital with their daughter and an elderly woman. We know this because their deaths - as he put his hands up in surrender trying desperately to stop Russian forces firing on the car they were travelling in - were caught on camera by a drone. In other places along the road attempts had been made to cover up the bodies. Our correspondent says we dont know what happened to these people but a credible working assumption for any investigation must be that the other dead people were killed by either the tank crew seen in the drone video or other Russian soldiers. The drone footage has been handed to the authorities for investigation. There have been numerous allegations of war crimes made since the start of the invasion in February and both the UN and the International Criminal Court are looking into them. Read Jeremy Bowens full report into what he and his team found here Russia accuses Ukraine of striking oil depot on its territory IMAGE SOURCE RUSSIAN EMERGENCIES MINISTRY/REUTERS Image caption Several fuel tanks are ablaze Russian media report Russia accused Ukraine of being responsible for a huge fire at an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod. Russian officials said two Ukrainian military helicopters had crossed the border from Ukraine and fired missiles at the facility. Vyacheslav Gladkov governor of the Russian city of Belgorod some 40km (25 miles) from the border said the early morning rocket attack left eight fuel tanks ablaze. Initial statements from Ukraine would neither confirm nor deny that - but later in the day the secretary of Ukraine\s security council Oleksiy Danilov said the Russian version of events does not correspond to reality. But if it is true that Ukraine mounted the attack our defence correspondent Jonathan Beale notes it would mark the first time that Ukrainian aircraft have flown into Russian airspace to hit a target bringing the war home to Russia. And it isnt impossible: the skills needed - flying low and fast to avoid detection - are ones Ukrainian pilots have been honing in recent years as the country battled separatists in the east.

Evacuation team fails to reach Mariupol IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS A Red Cross team which had hoped to make it to the besieged city of Mariupol to help with an evacuation effort was forced to turn back after arrangements and conditions made it impossible to proceed. The team of nine from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had been hoping to help evacuate some of the thousands of residents still trapped in the coastal city large parts of which have been destroyed in the fighting. The regional governor has accused Russia of breaking a promise to allow a humanitarian corridor out of Mariupol. The ICRC said it will try again on Saturday. It had initially been planned for Thursday. Whats happening in the east? Moscow has begun shifting its attention from the capital and the north in general trying instead to encircle Ukraines forces in the east of the country. Its army is moving south taking control of the city of Izyum and bombarding a succession of towns to the east. Eventually it hopes to move further south still to the town of Slovyansk. But what is it that Russia wants with this region known as the Donbas? On paper at least the aim is to liberate its Russian-speaking majority. The question remains: can Moscows forces defeat the Ukrainian army here and - crucially - do the people of this former coal and steel-producing region want to be liberated? As the BBCs Paul Kirby has been finding out a shared language may not be enough to win the regions loyalty.

Ukraine: Russia praises India for not judging war in 'one-sided way',India has offered support to Russia over Ukraine but is under pressure from other countries.,Ukraine: Russia praises India for not judging war in one-sided way Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption Sergei Lavrov (L) met S Jaishankar in Delhi Russia has praised India for not judging the conflict in Ukraine in a one-sided way as foreign ministers from both countries met in Delhi. India has not joined the widespread condemnation of Russias invasion and is a major buyer of Russian arms. But it faces a diplomatic balancing act and is under pressure from Western countries to help rein in Russia. Following the talks India said it favoured peaceful resolutions of conflicts but did not criticise Russia. India which is a nuclear power has a long history of pursuing a non-aligned strategy in international politics not tying itself to the interests of other superpowers or political blocs. Russia\s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov - who also met Indian\s Prime Minister Narendra Modi - spoke of the friendship between the two nations in his statement. These days our Western colleagues would like to reduce any meaningful international issue to the crisis in Ukraine he said. We] appreciate that India is taking this situation in the entirety of facts not just in a one-sided way. Russia has justified invading Ukraine as a means to demilitarise and de-Nazify its neighbour an argument widely dismissed by the West as a baseless pretext for invasion. Mr Lavrov\s Indian counterpart S Jaishankar emphasised the importance of cessation of violence and ending hostilities. Differences and disputes should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy and by respect for international law the] UN Charter sovereignty and territorial integrity of states India\s foreign ministry said.

FUEL: Could the world cope without Russian oil? READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis India needs Russian military hardware as deterrence against China with which it was involved in a deadly border clash with in 2020. China too has stopped short of condemning Russias actions in Ukraine. The US chief sanctions strategist Daleep Singh alluded to Russia-China ties when he warned India that Russia would not be a reliable ally ahead of the foreign ministers meeting. Russia is going to be the junior partner in this relationship with China. And the more leverage that China gains over Russia the less favourable that is for India he said. India stepped up purchases of Russia oil after prices slumped in the wake of Western sanctions. On Thursday UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she respected India\s decision to continue to buy oil but also urged like-minded nations to co-operate more closely on defence trade and energy and food security. In recent weeks theres been a conveyor belt of visiting dignitaries and diplomats whove come to India from the UK US China Japan Germany Austria Mexico Nepal and Greece. It seems as if every nation wants to get India on side - but India is resolutely staying neutral. Delhi prides itself on its independent foreign policy yet its ties with Russia run deep and are also practical - it buys the vast majority of its weapons from Moscow. The visit by Russias Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was a clear signal that India still sees Russia as an ally even if many world leaders view it as an aggressor. Prime Minister Modi even took time to meet Sergei Lavrov himself - contrast that to British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Chinas Foreign Minister Wang Yi both recent visitors who didnt get an audience. Indias relationship with Russia and its diplomatic balancing act could turn it into an unexpected broker. Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was open to India mediating in the crisis while a statement from Prime Minister Modis office said hed conveyed Indias readiness to contribute in any way to the peace efforts.]
Why Russia is trying to encircle Ukraine's east,"Russia has shifted most of the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine, aiming to ""liberate"" the region.",Why Russia is trying to encircle Ukraines east By Paul Kirby BBC News Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Russian troops now control large areas of the east but Ukraine has vowed to fight for every last metre Russia has shifted most of the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine after a series of setbacks especially around the capital Kyiv. This push into the area known as Donbas could signal a more prolonged conflict says the US. What would Vladimir Putin need before he could claim his goal of liberating Ukraine\s old industrial heart and is that possible? Russian forces have already triggered a humanitarian catastrophe in the east reducing Mariupol to ruins but they have failed to inflict defeat on Ukraine\s military. Warning of a new onslaught on the east President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed: We will fight for every metre of our land. Ukraine had already stationed its best-trained forces in the east because of an eight-year war with Russian-backed separatists. They are thought to have suffered heavy losses but are still a significant challenge to Russias invading army. What is Ukraines Donbas? When President Putin talks of Donbas he is referring to Ukraines old coal and steel-producing area. But he really means the entirety of two big eastern regions Luhansk and Donetsk which run from outside Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border. The key is that it has been identified by the Kremlin as a Russian-speaking part of Ukraine that is more Russia than Ukraine says Sam Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute. These areas may be broadly Russian-speaking but they are no longer pro-Russian. Mariupol was one of the most pro-Russian cities in Ukraine and to level it is beyond my comprehension says defence specialist Konrad Muzyka head of Rochan Consulting. Last week Russia claimed to have taken control of 93% of Luhansk region and 54% of Donetsk. Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukraines army in the east. They have taken control of Izyum - a strategic town on the road between Ukraines second city Kharkiv and the separatist areas - and have bombarded a succession of Luhansk towns including Rubizhne Lysychansk Popasna and Severodonetsk destroying blocks of flats and killing civilians in their homes. The towns that are now in Russian sights have already experienced years of war since 2014 and barely a day goes by now without a deadly attack. Civilians are being moved out ahead of the Russian advance. Local leader Serhiy Haidai said 20 children were led to safety from the basement of a kindergarten in Lysychansk on Thursday and some 200 civilians climbed on to buses in Severodonetsk. IMAGE SOURCE SERHIY HAIDAI/LUHANSK OVA Image caption More than 200 people were evacuated from Severodonetsk on Thursday They were leaving for western Ukraine with nothing said Mr Haidai but they were alive. Maryna Agafonova 27 fled her family\s home in Lysychansk earlier this week. At the start of the war she said Russian forces had targeted the outskirts of the town but had lately hit the centre. They attacked hospitals and residential buildings. There is no heating and no electricity. My parents are still there. Ukrainian forces were still holding out there in numbers she told the BBC: They don\t let the Russians occupy it. Russias next aim will be to push south to encircle Slovyansk a city of 125000 people that already experienced war at close hand when it was seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014 before being recaptured. War in Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine WAR CRIMES: Gruesome evidence on road to Kyiv YOUR QUESTIONS: Could Ukraine win the war? FUEL: Could the world cope without Russian oil? READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Why Putin wants to control Donbas The Russian leader has repeatedly made the unfounded accusation that Ukraine has carried out genocide in the east. When the war began two-thirds of the eastern regions were in Ukrainian hands. The rest was run by separatists who created Russian-backed statelets during a war that began eight years ago. If Russia were to conquer both big regions then the next step could be to annexe them too just like it did with Crimea in 2014. Before invading Ukraine President Putin recognised the entirety of the two eastern regions as independent of Ukraine. The Russian puppet leader in Luhansk has already spoken of a referendum in the near future although the idea of even a sham vote taking place in a war zone seems absurd. Scary existence in separatist Luhansk Life under the control of Russian-backed separatists is quieter although separatist authorities have accused Ukrainian forces of shelling residential buildings and killing civilians. Officials in the Donetsk statelet say 72 civilians have died since mid-February. One woman in Luhansk told the BBC on condition of anonymity that she had seen a lot of Russian military armour in the city and the atmosphere now was one of fear and caution. I\m scared - it\s just scary she said. Men of military age were required to join the local militia so anyone who avoided the draft was in hiding she explained. They\re mobilising men] on the streets catching them. There are no men in the shops in town on the streets. As a result all male-dominated businesses are shut she said. We\re already Russia although just informally. Everyone has a Russian passport. Will Ukraines forces hold out? At the start of the war the 10 brigades that made up the Joint Forces Operation (JFO) in the east were regarded as the best-equipped and best-trained soldiers that Ukraine has. We don\t really know the strength of Ukrainian forces now said Sam Cranny-Evans of Rusi who believes their numbers will have been boosted by volunteers in recent weeks. Russian forces have already sustained high losses after more than five weeks of conflict and morale is thought to be low. They are made up of men enlisted from the local separatist areas as well as the broader Russian army. However they have seized a considerable part of the south-east and will hope to control the entire stretch of coastal territory from Crimea to the Russian border. The main goal for the Ukrainians is to incur as big losses on the Russian side as possible and the Ukrainians are using asymmetric tactics to avoid big battles says Konrad Muzyka. One man called Mykyta who managed to flee the Russian bombardment of Mariupol said he was confident the Ukrainian army would succeed in fighting back. Some day they will return our cities the Azov battalion will not surrender Mariupol he told the BBC. The Ukrainian army is very cunning I didn\t see them in my city but I heard them they are very good at disguise.]
Ukraine war: Polish doctor saves family's sight after bombing,The mother of five-year-old twin boys describes how she tried to protect as their house was bombed.,Ukraine war: Polish doctor saves familys sight after bombing By Kasia Madera BBC News Lublin Poland Published 2 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war I went into the kitchen and saw a bomb coming towards my window. It was all so quick I didn\t know what was happening. I just saw it flying towards me. It was the morning of 11 March in the eastern Ukrainian region of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast when a bomb crashed into Olena Selichzianowas home - and her family. Speaking in Russian the mother of five-year-old twin boys Nazar and Timur describes how she fell to her knees pulling her sons beneath her to protect them from the pieces of shrapnel. After the bombs impact she recalls nothing. All three were blinded by the flying fragments that cut into their arms and faces. Their skin was badly burned a small shard of glass embedded itself in one of Olenas eyes and her leg was broken. Image caption Nazar and Timur have had several surgeries to try to save their sight The family were pulled from the wreckage and taken to a nearby hospital but their wounds were so serious they had to be moved quickly. In Lviv eye specialist Dr Nataliya Preys was made aware of this familys injuries. Dr Preys sent images of the wounds to her former teacher in Poland Professor Robert Rejdak at the Medical University of Lublin. He knew the three needed to be treated immediately. But the fighting in Ukraine meant it would take a week for Olena Nazar and Timur to reach Poland. A little bit of a miracle They have come from hell Professor Rejdak told us. The mum was completely blind she could only reach out to touch her children. The children were so hungry and tired when they first arrived that they only ate slept and cried. He is visibly moved as he recounts their first meeting. Then his expertise as a leading surgeon at one of Europes largest eye hospitals takes over. We decided to operate on mum. I performed bilateral cataract surgery. The surgery was really complicated because of the wounds because of a piece of glass inside one eye. Fortunately the surgery went really perfectly and Olena sees almost fully two days after. The healing process is perfect so I hope it will be even better - but at least now she can see her boys and look around. A journey out of Ukraine in real time Familys bid to reach safety ends in tragedy The little boys journey to health will take longer. Nazar has lost his eye. Professor Rejdaks team performed retina surgery and is now planning further cataract surgery. The twins also have really massive ocular trauma he says. We are hoping the vision will be good but they need longer treatment. If Olena and her boys had reached Lublin just a few days later the consequences would have been stark. They would be blind because it was the last moment to start the treatment it already took seven days from the accident and in ocular trauma time is crucial. When asked if it was a miracle to be able to save their sight Professor Rejdak says a little bit. Jumpy and struggling to sleep Back on the ward the little boys are playing. Although it is Nazar who has lost his eye he seems more protective over his brother Timur who is a little shyer and more withdrawn. A psychologist is helping them giving them tablets so they can sleep explains Olena. They are feeling better and have had many operations. But they saw the bomb fall on them. They are a little calmer but they are jumpy and they struggle to sleep. Before the war Olena was a cook at the local school. Once her family have healed would she want to go back? No she answers quickly. Everyone has been so kind here I want to stay. Also my home has been destroyed there is nothing left. Professor Rejdak is among those helping to find somewhere for this family to live. Once Olena has recovered and only when she is ready the hope is she that she will find a job. This is not the only family that needs help. Professor Rejdak is providing virtual consultations with his colleagues in Ukraine. Thanks to his teaching work he has a network of specialists. He works closely with his former pupil Dr Preys and advises who should be evacuated to receive surgery in Lublin. Image caption Professsor Rejdak is preparing for more people arriving from Ukraine If evacuation is not possible then he gives advice on how doctors in Lviv should proceed with treatment. He firmly believes virtual medicine is key to helping the victims of this war. Medical supplies and donations are also being sent to Ukraine by a team of people brought together under the umbrella of the Medical University of Lublin. The work is endless as more and more people are injured in the fighting. Professor Rejdak and his team will be operating on the twins again in the coming days but they are also preparing for new arrivals who will be coming to the hospital from Ukraine.

"Ukraine: UK visa process dehumanising, says relative",A woman helping her family to the UK criticises the bureacracy involved in the Ukraine Family Scheme.,Ukraine: UK visa process dehumanising says relative Published 1 day ago Share IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption Emily Radford is helping the cousin of her Ukrainian wife come to the UK The British wife of a Ukrainian woman has said the visa process for family members fleeing the war is dehumanising. Emily Radford said her partner a British citizen had gone to Poland to bring her cousins family to Sheffield. But she said the three-week visa process had been insane and needlessly bureacratic. The government said it had streamlined the scheme but security checks were vital. Under the Ukraine Family Scheme those fleeing the war are eligible for a UK visa if they are joining a family member based in the country. Ms Radford 39 has been helping the group - which includes four children aged 17. 12 eight and four with the application from home. Gruesome evidence points to war crimes on road to Kyiv How do Russians get news about the war in Ukraine? Could Ukraine win the war? And other questions After a long wait their visas were approved on Wednesday but Ms Radford was critical of the process. She was particularly upset that child applicants had to answer questions about terrorist affiliations and military history. They\ve treated what are primarily women and children as threats first rather than people to help she said. That\s not to say that if it was men it would be different - maybe it would maybe it wouldn\t. But it\s women and kids... I had to answer for a four-year-old: \Are you a terrorist? Have you ever been in the armed forces?\ Why are you asking those questions? It should literally just be: \Are you a child? Who is your mum? OK we\ll sort you out when you\re here and we can have questions with you then if we need to.\ IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption The 39-year-old hoped the family would fly to the UK on Friday Ms Radford said her wife whose name she asked to be withheld found the British visa application difficult. She said that the Polish people have been wonderful but as soon as she interacted with British bureaucracy she felt terrible which is really hard for me to hear as a British person Ms Radford said. She hopes her Ukrainian relatives will be able to fly to the UK on later to join she and her wife in Sheffield. A government spokesperson said: We are moving as quickly as possible to ensure that those fleeing Ukraine can find safety in the UK through the Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine. We continue to speed up visa processing across both schemes with 25500 visas issued in the last three weeks alone and thousands more expected to come through these uncapped routes. While we have streamlined the process simplified our forms and boosted case worker numbers vital security checks are needed to protect our borders and the British people from hostile state actors from Russia who would cynically take advantage of the support we are rightly providing to people fleeing Ukraine.

Cumbria-Ukraine refugee scheme numbers uncertain,"If applications are approved about 150 people would be able to live in the county, figures suggest.",Cumbria-Ukraine refugee scheme numbers uncertain Published 2 hours ago Share IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Cumbria County Council said it was scaling up its response team to help those who have fled the war About 100 households in Cumbria have registered to offer their homes to Ukrainian refugees under a government sponsorship scheme figures reveal. If applications are approved it would allow about 150 people to live in the county for up to three years. But the council said due to specific challenges with the plan there was still uncertainty about how many would eventually arrive. It comes as a community welcome fund has raised more than £30000 to help. The Homes for Ukraine scheme allows people to host refugees who dont have family ties in the UK with households offered £350 a month for up to 12 months. It was introduced after the government was criticised for not doing enough but critics have called the process too slow and bureaucratic. I sat in class wondering if my parents were dead How can I offer a UK home to Ukrainian refugees? The county council will receive £10500 for each refugee which will go towards supporting them locally. While it has several roles in the process including housing suitability checks it has no part in registering or matching sponsors the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Deborah Earl cabinet member for public health and communities said it was scaling up its team to respond. Specific challenges It is no small step to invite strangers to live with you and we and our partners will work with you to make this experience as positive as possible for everyone involved she said. There is no doubt however that there are specific challenges with this scheme not least the uncertainty of how many Ukrainians will eventually arrive and where they will be accommodated. The government said it was moving as quickly as possible to ensure refugees from Ukraine can find safety in the UK through its two schemes. We have streamlined the process so valid passport holders do not have to attend in-person appointments before arriving in the UK simplified our forms and boosted caseworker numbers while ensuring vital security checks are carried out a spokesperson added.

Ukraine war: Bucha street littered with burned-out tanks and corpses,"A BBC team witnesses utter devastation in the town of Bucha, after Russian soldiers pulled out.",Ukraine war: Bucha street littered with burned-out tanks and corpses By Jeremy Bowen BBC News Bucha Published 9 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE BBC/LEE DURANT Image caption A Bucha street littered with destroyed Russian armoury A suburban avenue in Bucha became one of the first graveyards for Russias hopes of encircling and entering Kyiv and then deposing the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky. The moment came two or three days after the first Russian forces crossed into Ukraine on 24 February when Ukrainian forces destroyed a column of Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers moving through the town of Bucha to the city of Kyiv. The convoy was destroyed in one of the first of many Ukrainian ambushes that stopped the Russian advance dead. Our BBC team was able to get to Bucha because during Friday the final Russian soldiers pulled out as part of what the Kremlin has presented as a calm and rational decision to concentrate on the war in eastern Ukraine. Moscow says without proof or any reliability that its war aims in central Ukraine have been achieved and they never included capturing Kyiv. The truth is that unexpectedly fierce and well organised Ukrainian resistance stopped them outside the capital and the evidence includes the rusting and twisted wreckage of the column that still lies where it was destroyed on that suburban street. IMAGE SOURCE BBC/KATHY LONG Image caption Local residents say they hadnt had any bread for weeks Two or three weeks into the war the Russian invaders ran out of momentum. On the street in Bucha you can see why. Elite troops from Russias airborne forces rode into the town in armoured vehicles light enough to be carried by aircraft. They came from Hostomel airport a few miles away which had been attacked and seized by Russian paratroopers landed by helicopter on the first day of the invasion. Even then there was fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces. When the column moved through Bucha on the way to Kyiv they had a harsh awakening. The road is narrow and straight an ideal place for an ambush. Witnesses said the Ukrainians attacked the convoy with Bayraktar attack drones bought from Turkey. Other neighbours said Ukrainian territorial defence volunteers were also in the area. However they did it the lead vehicles and the ones bringing up the rear were knocked out and imprisoned the others. The wreckage has not been touched. Belts of 30mm cannon shells lie on the grass verge along with many pieces of dangerous and damaged abandoned ordnance. Young conscripts ran away begging local people said not to be turned over to Ukrainian territorial defence. A man of around 70 who called himself uncle Hrysha said: I felt sorry for them. They were so young 18 to 20 with their whole lives ahead of them. It looks as if Russians as they prepared to pull out of Bucha had no such pity. At least 20 dead men were lying in the street as Ukrainian troops entered the town. Some of them had their hands tied behind their backs. The mayor said they had buried 280 people in mass graves. A few civilians who stayed said they had tried to avoid the Russians. They set up wood fires outside their Khrushchev-era flats cooking on them outdoors because their gas power and water were cut. Volunteers are bringing supplies in from Lviv in western Ukraine and from countries far from the war geographically at least. This is the first bread we\ve had in 38 days said a woman called Maria looking at a plastic bag with some modest looking buns inside. Her daughter Larysa showed me round the Soviet-built apartment building. Many of the people who had left for safer areas or abroad had bolted shut security doors. The Russians removed them by ripping out the concrete lintels and door posts. IMAGE SOURCE BBC/KATHY LONG Image caption Doors ripped off in a Bucha apartment block A few miles away the trail of devastation leads to Hostomel airport. Russian airborne troops tried to use it as a base for a push into Kyiv. The worlds largest transport plane was destroyed early on. The roof of the enormous hangar built for it was so riddled with a constellation of shrapnel holes. The plane itself known by the Ukrainian word for dream (Mriya) lies there broken-backed big chunks of fuselage and engine in places around it. Its fate is a parable of what is happening to Ukraine. An enormous amount of national pride was invested in the aircraft as a symbol of Ukraines ability to make big projects all round the world.

"Ukraine war: Europe's new security era, faced with Russian threat","Many commentators say Ukraine's war has united Europe as hasn't been seen in years, but are they right?",Ukraine war: Europes new security era faced with Russian threat Katya Adler Europe editor @BBCkatyaadler on Twitter Published 11 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption A banner of Russian President Vladimir Putin next to the Moscow embassy in Riga Latvia Era defining new reality historic moment - that\s where we are right now in Europe. At least that\s what countless European politicians and commentators say since Russian President Vladimir Putin began his invasion of Ukraine. Are they right? Yes and No Id argue. Starting with the Yes. On 24 February President Putin shocked this continent out of complacency. His assault on Ukraine has brought large-scale death and destruction back to Europe including whispers of possible nuclear war. His aim: not only to dominate Ukraine but to roll back Western dominance militarily and - ideally - politically in terms of liberal democracy from the former Soviet sphere of influence. The action Western allies take together now will fundamentally affect Europeans sense of self and safety for years to come. Nato is re-invigorated. The transatlantic military alliance once dismissed by French President Emmanuel Macron as brain dead is simultaneously proving Mr Putin wrong to view the West as weak and disunited while also providing military support defence and deterrence to Nato\s eastern flank that feels so exposed to the Kremlin\s expansionist fervour. This - so far - is also proving to be a defining moment for the EU. The bloc had long talked up playing a bigger role on the world stage - and not solely in terms of economics and trade. Until now that was a failed ambition. But the Russia-Ukraine crisis has unexpectedly elevated the EU into a credible geopolitical player. The speed with which Brussels co-ordinated sanctions against Russia - both within the EU and with international allies - was frankly impressive. As were the unity of resolve amongst member states and the bureaucracy-defying EU moves to enact never-before-used mechanisms to help Ukrainian refugees and the Ukrainian military. Germany one of the EUs biggest players also took the worlds breath away by suddenly saying goodbye to World War Two sensitivities and announcing huge investments in its military the Bundeswehr. Key to the decision being applauded in the EU and further afield is that this is not a Germany newly flexing nationalist muscles. This is about Germany helping to re-define Europe not its own role Ricarda Lang told me. She is the co-chair of the German Green Party in the coalition government. It\s about European sovereignty not just in security and defence but also in terms of imports and energy. For years Germany has knowingly been reliant on the US for security and on Russia for energy and trade. It is not the only EU country in that position. But as the blocs richest and most powerful nation Berlin is the most stand-out example. And this has weakened the Wests hand when it comes to sanctions against Russia. EU countries pay Moscow up to €800m (£674m; $884m) for energy every day which amounts to an estimated 40% of the Kremlins income. This money goes towards funding the war against Ukraine that the West is ostensibly fighting. It\s tragic it took a war like this but now we Germans have woken up with a bang! insists Marie Agnes Strack-Zimmerman who heads the German parliament\s Defence Committee. She assured me Berlin was now ready to take responsibility. Image caption We Germans have woken up with a bang! said the chairwoman of the German parliaments Defence Committee The West looked at Germany with suspicion after two world wars she observed but that was decades ago and - to be honest she said - Germany was pretty comfortable enjoying being a Nato and EU member without having to invest in its own army. Germany\s allies have waited too long for us to do our bit. Berlin has now pledged to build an efficient modern military and to keep up defence spending to Nato requirements. Under international pressure trade and energy ties are being tackled too. Bear in mind though that transforming the currently threadbare German military will take years as will untangling the country from its deep-seated relations with Russia. For decades Berlin was the dividing line between East and West Europe. Hopes for European unity were high after the fall of the iconic Berlin Wall and the ensuing 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union. But fast-forward 30 years and you hear talk of a new Berlin Wall though further to the east. Tiny Baltic country Latvia has a 200km (124 mile)-long border fence separating the EU and Nato member on one side from expansionist Russia on the other. Col Sandris Gaugers is the commander of the Latvian Land Forces Mechanized Infantry Brigade. We spoke at his military base just outside the capital Riga. The base is also home to Nato forces which have almost doubled in size since Russia invaded Ukraine. Image caption Col Sandris Gaugers said priorities have changed across Europe I see a new Iron Curtain coming. Though this time we\ll be on the western side the colonel told me. We are living a new reality. For us Latvians the security environment is now gone. We spent 20 years in Iraq in Afghanistan. Now our main focus is here. How do we defend our freedom and our country? Priorities have now changed across Europe he said. People used to focus on economic wealth. Now it\s about defending our values and way of life. Latvians and their Baltic neighbours in Estonia and Lithuania are trying hard not to say I-told-you-so to the West. They\ve been warning about President Putin for years. They feel they understand the Russian leader better than most. All three countries were once part of the Soviet Union. Latvia\s Prime Minister Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš insists the West has to accept that Putin is not like us. France and German leaders famously went on diplomatic visits to Moscow earlier this year trying to dissuade President Putin from attacking Ukraine. Prime Minister Kariņš says agonising over finding the right words or turns of phrase to persuade Mr Putin is pointless. He\s hell-bent on destroying democracy and our way of life. If we don\t stop Putin. He will not stop at Ukraine. Mr Kariņš said the one good thing to come out of the current situation is that Nato and the EU are working closer together than they have in 30 years. That he said was a game-changer. And here we come back to whether this is an era-defining moment for Europe. Or maybe not. The EU is thrilled to have the US back and engaged in Europe. For all Brussels\ talk of the bloc now building strategic sovereignty in defence and security EU countries look to Washington when faced with Russian threats. Image caption Training session at the Adazi military base in Latvia EU defence plans designed to complement - or to partly replace - Nato depending which European politician you speak to are nothing new. And so far theyve never worked. All EU countries agree that at the very least it makes sense to pool resources and know-how: cyber military equipment and intelligence. Yet no nation wants to go first. Each EU member has businesses or individuals benefiting from national contracts. The European Commission now wants to oversee the overhaul of defence capabilities. Few in the military are holding their breath wherever they reside in Europe. As regards the renaissance in EU-Nato co-operation in all likelihood once the acute Russia-Ukraine crisis subsides the US will turn its attention to what it truly sees as its foreign policy priority: the Asia-Pacific not Europe. But the EU has its raison dêtre back. Designed originally as a peace project its vision fell by the wayside in recent times. Younger Europeans had no memory of war. They saw no urgency in uniting or fighting for peace on their continent. In that regard this moment really is a new reality. Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Nato Vladimir Putin European Union]

An AFP news agency reporter in Bucha near Kyiv counted at least 20 bodies. At least one man had his hands tied. Ukrainian forces regained control of the town this week and photos show widespread devastation. BBC journalists in another part of Ukraine found the bodies of two civilians killed by Russian forces. Warning: Some readers may find content in this story distressing including a photo lower down. Earlier this week the BBCs Jeremy Bowen and his team counted a total of 13 bodies some of whom may have been Ukrainian soldiers along a stretch of road between the villages of Mria and Myla. Ukraine says Russian forces have made a rapid retreat from around Kyiv with one official saying the whole region around the capital has been retaken since the invasion began on 24 February. The invasion has seen thousands killed in ferocious fighting and has made refugees of at least four million Ukrainians. Western states have responded with tough sanctions against Russia and military supplies for Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought to justify his attack by arguing that Ukraine a former Soviet state with Nato and EU ambitions was a constant threat and Russia could not feel safe develop and exist. In Bucha where a photographer for Reuters news agency also recorded dead bodies holes gaped from apartment blocks hit by shelling and crushed cars littered the streets. Sixteen of the 20 bodies seen by AFP lay either on the pavement or by the verge. Three were sprawled in the middle of the road and another lay on his side in the courtyard of a destroyed house. An open Ukrainian passport lay on the ground next to the person who had his hands tied behind his back with a piece of white cloth. Two other people had white cloth tied around their upper arms. Warning: There is a photo below that some readers may find distressing A Ukrainian official told AFP the dead men could have been killed in a bombardment or shot by Russian soldiers and police would investigate. But the towns mayor Anatoly Fedoruk told AFP by phone that all of the 20 dead had been shot in the back of the head. He added that other bodies still lay inside the wrecks of cars destroyed by shelling. The town he said had buried 280 people in mass graves as a result of the Russian invasion.

Ukraine war: Family’s bid to reach safety ends in tragedy,The father of 31-year-old Maksim Iovenko describes how his son and family ended up on a deadly stretch of highway outside Kyiv.,Ukraine war: Family’s bid to reach safety ends in tragedy By Abdujalil Abdurasulov and Mal Siret BBC News Published 11 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE SUPPLIED Image caption Ksenia and Maksim met while working at the same travel agency in Kyiv The drone footage shows three cars speeding along an empty main road just outside the Ukrainian capital Kyiv when they suddenly turn around and race back - all except one. This white car turns but then stops. A man steps out and raises his hands. Then his body falls to the ground. Moments later Russian soldiers approach. An elderly woman and child leave the car and a soldier walks them away. The man on the ground was Maksim Iovenko. The 31-year-old was shot dead by Russian forces that were positioned at the roadside. His wife Ksenia who was in the car was also killed. Their six-year-old son and the elderly friend of the family who were with them escaped although she was wounded and remains in hospital. (Both families asked us not to name them.) Until I saw the video I still had some hope Maksim\s father Sergiy Iovenko tells the BBC in Kyiv where he lives. I was hoping that he was alive. The incident happened on 7 March when Maksim and his family joined a convoy of about 10 cars of civilians trying to reach Kyiv from the western outskirts of the city which had become a conflict zone. It was filmed by a Ukrainian territorial defence group doing aerial reconnaissance and widely shared. Media caption Video captured by a Ukrainian aerial reconnaissance group appears to show Russian forces shooting at civilians When a friend of Maksim\s who was part of the convoy called Sergiy to tell him the news Sergiy says he immediately knew something was wrong. There was silence when he picked up the phone and eventually the friend said: Stay strong your son and daughter-in-law are gone. Maksim lived in Kyiv and worked for a travel agency which is where he and Ksenia met. Sergiy describes his son as a family man with a kind heart who liked to sing karaoke. But his biggest hobby was his family he says. He loved his son very much and this was his passion. Like many other Ukrainians Sergiy says he and his family didnt believe Russian President Vladimir Putin would invade. Once Putin did Maksim thought Kyiv would be one of the first cities to be shelled. Having discussed the situation with an old school friend Maksim and his family moved west to the friends second home or dacha on the outskirts of Kyiv not far from the E-40 highway where the shooting would happen. Maksim told his father he thought it would be quieter there. It turned out the opposite Sergiy says. While Russias main focus appeared to be on the east and south of the country Russian forces also started bombing towns and cities to the west of the capital such as Irpin Bucha and Hostomel - close to where Maksim was staying. Sergiy says he would often hear the sound of the heavy bombing from his home in Kyiv. Maksim wouldn\t say much about conditions at the dacha Sergiy says. He would say \it is quiet peaceful all is normal.\ Maksim and his friend also called Maksim would take turns patrolling the area overnight Sergiy says. Power outages and poor mobile signal meant regular contact was difficult. As the bombing continued they moved into the basement leaving only to buy food. Then on 7 March they lost all power. With no electricity heating or food Maksim Ksenia and other families staying in the area decided to return to Kyiv. They knew they risked running into Russian troops along the highway but they thought they could make it through safely. Maksim\s car was third in the convoy made up of about 50 people in total including other children. In the windows of his car he had put handwritten signs on white paper that read: Children. His friend was part of the same convoy and it was his mother who was in the car with Maksim and Ksenia and he was able to tell Sergiy what happened. When the shooting started Maksim\s car was hit. The car\s engine stalled Sergiy says. My son jumped out of the car he raised his hands and started shouting that there was a child in the car so that the child would be saved. Its not clear why the rest of the convoy fell behind the first three cars but Sergiy believes many of those driving behind turned back when they saw the cars in front turning and heard the gunshots. After the shooting Maksims body was left on the highway and Ksenias was left in the car. Maksims son and his friends mother were told by Russian soldiers to walk back along the road. When they got a safe distance from the Russian soldiers she called her husband who came to take them to safety. They returned to the dacha and were evacuated safely to Kyiv the next day. IMAGE SOURCE JEREMY BOWEN Image caption A burned out car on the road where Maksim and Ksenia were killed The boy is with his grandmother in a safe location in Ukraine but away from Kyiv where Sergiy remains. On Friday Sergiy received a call informing him that the area had been re-taken by Ukrainian forces. There was more bad news. They burned everyone. Burned the cars as well Sergiy says. A team of BBC journalists taken to the same stretch of road saw many burned cars and bodies. Among them was Maksims car riddled with shrapnel and reduced to a shell by fire with the burned remains of a body inside it and one on the road beside it still wearing a wedding ring.

Ukraine round-up: Russia sets gas deadline for West and troops leave Chernobyl,"President Putin demands roubles for gas supplies, as Russian troops redeploy around Ukraine.",Ukraine round-up: Russia sets gas deadline for West and troops leave Chernobyl Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES More than five weeks into Russias war on Ukraine Moscow has threatened to cut off Western nations from natural gas supplies - something that could affect energy prices across Europe. Vladimir Putin has followed through on weeks of threats by signing a decree that foreign countries they must start paying for gas in Russian roubles or it will halt supplies. And those new rules start on Friday meaning Western nations were effectively handed a midnight deadline to comply. Nobody sells us anything for free and we are not going to do charity either - that is existing contracts will be stopped the Russian president said. Many payments for April gas deliveries are reportedly not due until later in the month so it is not thought that there is an immediate threat to supplies. It is also still unclear whether the new payment mechanism set out by Russia would fully ban euros. But France and Germany condemned Mr Putin\s demands as being akin to blackmail. Western companies and governments have previously rejected Russias demands to pay for gas in roubles as a breach of existing contracts which are set in euros or US dollars. Yet the EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia and there is no ready-to-go replacement. Notably the EU did not enact sanctions on Russian fuel supplies - even though other Western nations such as the US and Canada did. Mr Putins demand to be paid in roubles is widely seen as an attempt to boost the currency which has been hit by the wide range of international sanctions that followed the invasion of Ukraine. Read the full story about the midnight gas deadline here. Most Russian troops leaving Chernobyl Ukraine says IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Many Russian troops occupying the former nuclear power plant at Chernobyl have left Ukraines state nuclear operator has said. Energoatom said two columns of Russian forces had set off towards the Belarusian border on Thursday morning leaving just a few soldiers at the site. Several days ago the mayor of Slavutych a nearby town housing workers at the plant announced that Russian troops had also left the town. The withdrawal follows reports that some Russian soldiers are being treated for radiation poisoning in Belarus after spending time in the most contaminated part of the Chernobyl exclusion zone. The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was investigating the report. Russias occupation of the site since 24 February the day of the invasion has been dogged with concerns about power outages and problems for the staff many of whom were trapped there for weeks and could not get home. It is the site of what is considered to be the worlds worst nuclear accident in 1986 and while no longer a working power station Chernobyl still requires constant management. Russia redeploying not retreating Troops leaving some occupied areas might sound like a win for Ukraine but Western intelligence warns that Russia is redeploying rather than retreating. Russia is trying to regroup resupply and reinforce Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said. Russia said earlier this week that it was planning to radically reduce its military activity in some places - such as near the capital Kyiv or the city of Chernihiv - and concentrate on the eastern Donbas region. Shelling continues on cities including those Russia suggested it would reduce its assault on but Mr Stoltenberg said Nato can see Russia re-positioning troops. Echoing Mr Stoltenberg\s remarks the UK\s Defence Secretary warned that Russia\s change in tactics was not a retreat and that it was changing its focus after its first efforts were rebutted.

Mariupol evacuation delayed Red Cross says IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS The evacuation of thousands of civilians from the besieged south-eastern city of Mariupol has been delayed until Friday the Red Cross has said. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said a convoy of 45 Ukrainian buses was on its way to the port city but humanitarian officials said the operation had been delayed for security and logistical concerns. One resident of the city Yevgen described the humanitarian disaster civilians have faced to the BBC. It was constant bombing he said. Planes went past every 10 minutes and dropped bombs on Mariupol. People were falling and dying in front of my eyes. We buried people in gardens. Another resident Natalia said Russia soldiers have been infiltrating the city and offering food to civilians in a PR campaign. Some people couldn\t resist taking them because they hadn\t eaten for several days she said. When you\re suffering like that you\ll take anything. The BBCs Lucy Williamson has the story of Mariupols refugees safe in Lviv telling their stories. French intelligence chief fired over Russian war failings IMAGE SOURCE ECPAD Image caption Gen Eric Vidaud was commander of special forces until he took on the military intelligence role seven months ago The head of French military intelligence Gen Eric Vidaud is set to lose his job after failing to predict Russias war in Ukraine French media has reported. Seven months after he took on the role one report said he was blamed for inadequate briefings and a lack of mastery of subjects. The US correctly assessed that Russia was planning a large-scale invasion while France concluded it was unlikely. In early March Gen Burkhard acknowledged that French intelligence had not been up to the level of US or UK briefings which were publicised to pile pressure on Russia\s Vladimir Putin. The Americans said that the Russians were going to attack they were right he told Le Monde newspaper. Our services thought instead that the cost of conquering Ukraine would have been monstrous and the Russians had other options to bring down the government of Ukraine\s Volodymyr Zelensky he added. Are tech companies removing evidence of war crimes? IMAGE SOURCE MIKE KEMP/GETTY IMAGES Social media companies are used to pulling down vast amounts of content that break the rules erasing it from the internet. Theyre expected to do so by governments and regulators. But what happens when efficient artificial intelligence moderators are removing evidence of possible war crimes sweeping it away from investigators eyes? TikTok for example does not allow shock value or violence or anything that is gratuitously sadistic or gruesome. But Ukrainians uploading videos from the ground could be generating more than likes BBC technology reporter James Clayton writes. They may well be uploading a piece in a jigsaw of evidence that will one day be used to prosecute war crimes. Read more from James about the thorny issue here.

Could Ukraine 'win' the war? And other questions,BBC reporters Jenny Hill and Orla Guerin - on the ground - answer your questions about the war in Ukraine.,Could Ukraine win the war? And other questions Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Russia continues to face fierce resistance from Ukraine more than a month into its invasion. Ukrainian forces have begun attempts to retake some areas from Russia which said this week it would scale back operations around Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv. Meanwhile four million people have fled Ukraine and a quarter of the countrys population is thought to be displaced. Two of the BBCs reporters on the ground answer your questions. Orla Guerin is in Kyiv Ukraines capital Jenny Hill is in the Russian capital Moscow In light of the recent counter-attacks that Ukraine has undertaken and assuming that diplomatic talks between Ukraine and Russia fail is it possible that Ukraine may be able to win this war militarily? - Harry Tinsley Orla Guerin writes: In military terms its a case of so far so good for Ukraine. It has surprised President Putin and the world by mounting skilled and stubborn resistance against a larger better equipped army. Equally Russian forces have surprised the world by being disorganised and inept. We saw an example of Ukraines success in battle at a frontline position outside Kyiv last week. Ukrainian forces told us the Russians had tried to break through four times in the past month and each time had been held back. The evidence was there in the form of about a half dozen burnt-out Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers. Russias invasion is now in its sixth week and it has failed on the key fronts - the Russians have not managed to enter the capital Kyiv to topple the government or to take any major city - bar Kherson - in the south. Russia has destroyed more than it has captured. Thats a poor return on a costly invasion. That said its too early to predict the outcome here. We may be at the start of a long war. Russia says it will focus now on the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. It may have little choice having failed to make gains elsewhere. But in the future it could resume trying to capture more territory elsewhere. Mr Putins fate is probably tied to the success or failure of the invasion. He may continue to pour in troops and armour and heavy weapons over the longer term. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption A destroyed Russian tank in Trostyanets Ukraine. With Russia recruiting from the Middle East does this show a lack of confidence in the quality of its own forces? - David Carter Jenny Hill writes: The Kremlin would never admit to it but there is evidence that at least some of the Russian troops are inexperienced and unprepared for their mission. The Ministry of Defence was recently forced to admit that - contrary to Mr Putins claims - conscripts had been sent to fight in Ukraine. Moscow claims to have 16000 Middle Eastern volunteers many of whom fought against Isis in the last decade ready to join Russian troops. They may have more experience than some of their Russian counterparts and some experts say they\d probably be more skilled in the kind of urban combat necessary to take cities and towns. Some argue too that they\d be less reluctant to attack or kill Ukrainian civilians (many Russians have close ties to Ukraine and consider the people there to be brethren) and that they have a reputation for brutality which could have a psychological effect on Ukrainian troops. The Kremlin presumably knows all this which is why it was so keen to publicise its access to Middle Eastern fighters - even though it has not yet officially confirmed that it will actually send them in. To what extent will unexploded ordnance remain an issue for Ukraine after the war? Is there potential for large areas of land to be deemed inaccessible as a result? - Robbie Orla Guerin writes: Sadly yes as so often in conflict the danger to human life will remain long after the guns eventually fall silent. The danger comes not only from unexploded ordnance but also from landmines. They can kill for years to come unless and until demining organisations can clear frontline areas. I have seen these organisations at work after other wars. Their work is painstaking and time-consuming. Before the invasion began there was already a war raging in the east of the country between Russian-backed separatists and the government of Ukraine. It began in 2014 and has dragged on ever since. While reporting from frontlines there in late January and February we had to carefully skirt many minefields. At that time the snow was melting - turning the soil to mud. In these conditions mines can easily shift from their original location (which may have been marked on maps or fenced off). Currently in the commuter town of Irpin north of Kyiv the Ukrainian army says there is a high risk to life because of mines in the streets. Is it getting more or less likely that the people in Russia will overthrow Mr Putin or cause greater civil unrest the longer the conflict lasts? - Damien Fieldhouse Somerset Jenny Hill writes: Less likely. The Kremlin comes down hard on those who oppose the war and many Russians who think that way have fled. What were almost daily street protests have dwindled. State opinion polls have to be viewed with some cynicism but they consistently show majority (and growing) support for Mr Putin and for his special military operation. Given that most independent Russian media outlets have been blocked or forced to close there are few alternatives to state media which sticks to the Kremlin narrative. That says that Russian troops have only gone into Ukraine to defend the Russian-speaking population from attacks and genocide perpetrated by Ukrainian nationalists and neo-Nazis. If you only watched state TV you might well conclude that this is indeed an honourable and necessary operation to save Russian speakers and Russia itself from an aggressive Ukraine which with the help of America is developing biological weapons and is desperate to get its hands on nuclear ones. Sanctions are starting to have a noticeable effect with prices rising but the Kremlin frames this as another example of Western aggression. At this stage its hard to see any public dissatisfaction evolving into revolution. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Who is going to pay to rebuild the damage inflicted on infrastructure in Ukraine - never mind the human cost? - Steve Sandercott Rugby Orla Guerin writes: The greatest cost is the human one and that is increasing by the day. The verified civilian death toll according to the United Nations is about 1200 people but the real number will be far higher. Add to this the fact that four million Ukrainians have had to flee and become refugees in other countries. There is also extensive physical destruction in cities and towns across this vast country. Nowhere has suffered more than Mariupol in the south where we spent 10 days in the countdown to the invasion. At that point it was a bustling port city with trendy cafes busy restaurants and families strolling in the parks. Satellite imagery of Mariupol now shows mostly scorched earth with 90% of residential buildings damaged or destroyed. As many as 5000 people are known to have been killed in this city alone according to Ukrainian officials. They say the actual death toll could be twice that. Ukraine\s President Volodymyr Zelensky has promised to restore every house every street and every city. He says Russia will have to learn the word \reparations\ and pay the full cost. Ukraine will certainly want reparations to be a key part of any deal done to end the war. If Russia pays - and how much - will depend on who has the upper hand when that deal is done. Theoretically Russian assets abroad frozen by G7 countries could be used to help foot the bill. If a peace deal were to happen how would Ukraine/Russia deal with Crimea the regions taken by Russia in the Donbas this past month and the areas that have been controlled by Russian-backed rebels for the past few years? - Ryan McGauley Jenny Hill writes: We know that Mr Putin wants the world to recognise Crimea which Russia annexed in 2014 as Russian. During negotiations earlier this week the Ukrainian side suggested that Crimeas status be negotiated over 15 years as part of an overall peace deal although its hard to see Mr Putin agreeing to that. He also wants the international community to recognise (as he has) the self-proclaimed peoples\ republics of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent (although this would basically mean Russian-controlled). Given that the Kremlin\s current plan is to intensify its efforts in eastern Ukraine in order to liberate the whole Donbas region we can assume that Mr Putin intends to try to take - and hold on to - the region. Weve seen the Ukrainian military be very effective in certain areas. What prevents the military from destroying the Russian artillery that is shelling their cities? - Paul Ackrill Orla Guerin writes: Independent military experts point to one possible factor. They say Russia is firing artillery from tracked vehicles that can quickly move location once they have fired. That makes them harder to target. Ukrainian forces have told us they also are constrained because of the presence of civilians in built-up areas from which Russia is firing. They dont want to risk killing their own people while targeting Russian artillery. This has been an issue in the towns like Bucha outside Kyiv where some civilians remained despite the presence of Russian forces. Around Kyiv Ukrainian forces have managed to push back the Russians limiting the scope for them to use artillery. Because the city centre is out of reach Mr Putins men have been unable to bombard Kyiv as they have Mariupol and have resorted to air strikes. However Ukrainian air defences have been working well. Several times here in Kyiv we have heard the massive bang when a Russian missile is brought down - sometimes with casualties on the ground. In general Ukraine has been pleading for more and better air defence systems to help it curb the Russian threat. And the constant demand here is for Nato to impose a no-fly zone. We have met civilians fleeing the shelling of Irpin who pleaded for Nato to close the skies. However few here believe there is any chance of that because of Western fears of becoming embroiled in a wider war. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Ukrainian servicemen prepare for battle east of Kyiv Mr Putin has placed massive restrictions on the media in Russia but is there a possibility that news reported by Ukraine - for example the numbers of deaths of troops and civilians - is not wholly accurate? - Sarah Oxford Orla Guerin writes: Both sides are fighting an information war as well as the war on the battlefields. In any conflict information from any of the warring parties - about civilian deaths territory captured or enemy soldiers killed - has to be taken with caution. This is especially true now in relation to Russia - which is trying to ensure that its people receive only the Kremlin\s version of events. It still refuses to admit that it invaded Ukraine and refers only to its special military operation. We prioritise first-hand reporting which is why the BBC has teams in so many parts of Ukraine - gathering testimony from people on the ground including civilians medical staff local officials and the Ukrainian military. Ukraine is acknowledging that it has suffered losses and BBC teams in different cities have been able to report on the funerals of Ukrainian soldiers killed in battle. We cant know yet if the full extent of the losses is being made public. Are there any anti-war Russians? Are they safe? - Roanna Brighton Jenny Hill writes: Yes there are but its difficult to assess how widespread such dissent really is. Speaking out against the war - or even telling the truth about what Mr Putin continues to insist is only a special military operation - can result in a criminal conviction and possibly a jail sentence. Its reported that more than 15000 people were detained for taking part in almost daily street protests during the first three weeks of the invasion. Most independent journalists and many Russians who oppose the invasion have fled the country for places like Turkey Armenia and Georgia. The Kremlin calls them traitors and some of those who have stayed have become the target of abuse or attacks. We are seeing the point of view of frontline Ukrainian soldiers but is it possible to get the perspective from the Russian side? Are you prevented by the Russians from reporting on and talking to Russian troops on the ground in Ukraine? - Robert Bishops Stortford Jenny Hill writes: I cant answer for my colleagues currently in Ukraine but the Kremlin tightly controls the flow of information back to Russia. The Ministry of Defence issues frequent updates which consistently emphasise the success of the special military operation. Russian soldiers are banned from using smartphones and Moscow has made it a criminal offence to publish information which would discredit the Russian military or to spread what the Kremlin would deem to be fake news about it. An independent organisation exists which aims to help families of servicemen to get information about them. However theyve recently told us that theyre under considerable pressure from the authorities to stop their activities.

South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) said the supplies could maintain a field hospital for up to a fortnight. It said the items could potentially save thousands of lives while they await emergency surgery in hospital. Supplies have come from Oxfordshire Hampshire Buckinghamshire Berkshire Surrey and Sussex. Image caption All of the items loaded into the lorry will be taken further into Ukraine by humanitarian groups They were being packed by staff and volunteers on Friday at Boundary Park in Didcot. Preparations will continue on Saturday. All of the supplies will fit into a lorry and will go directly to field hospitals. Kate Ellis paramedic team leader said: SCAS has been very kind and donated items that we don\t use any more. We\re sending a huge amount of stuff to help those out in the field. Image caption The items will mean severely injured soldiers and civilians can be treated for up to 24 hours before being taken to hospital The lorries will be driven out of Oxfordshire by Ukrainian nationals on Saturday evening and will be unloaded at a depot in western Ukraine. They will then be taken further into the country by humanitarian groups. Paul Wilson from Grove is helping the effort. His Ukrainian wife Svetlana is in Poland trying to secure a UK visa for her mother who escaped her home country last week. Everything you see here is going directly to Ukraine and it\s going to the places that need it the most - Odessa Mykolaiv Chernihiv Kharkiv Kyiv Lviv. All of the places where people are injured we are sending medical aid and food to keep them going he said. Will Hancock chief executive of SCAS said: We are all extremely proud of this work to support those most in need. The resolve everyone has shown to not only keep delivering in the day job after such a tough time of late but also drive forward with this outstanding voluntary programme is truly amazing.

Lincoln City to silence Dambusters March and air raid sirens due to Ukraine war,"Lincoln City has asked supporters to support the move, sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",Lincoln City to silence Dambusters March and air raid sirens due to Ukraine war Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GEOGRAPH/STEVE DANIELS Image caption Lincoln City supporters have backed a move to stop playing the Dambusters March at home games A football club has suspended the playing of the Dambusters March and the use of an air raid siren at matches while the war in Ukraine continues. Traditionally the famous World War Two film theme had been played before each Lincoln City home game while the siren was sounded ahead of corner kicks. But the club and fans said they should be silenced for the rest of the season. Lincoln City claims a long association with the Dambusters 617 Squadron which was based at nearby RAF Scampton. The EFL League One side agreed the move at a supporters board meeting. Challenging matter Lincoln City FC chief executive Liam Scully said the club wanted to strike an appropriate balance between its long-standing synonymous gestures and actions. The decision was a very challenging matter to navigate and could polarise views Mr Scully said. He asked asked fans to support the move in the spirit the decision was made and said it would be reviewed at the end of the season. However Lincoln City fan Alex Webber said he did not feel that playing the Dambusters March was disrespectful. I believe the club should look at reinstating our anthem before the matches and in the second half when the teams come out he said. I can understand not using the air raid siren due to the ongoing bombing in Ukraine and how that would make people feel. IMAGE SOURCE GEOGRAPH/RICHARD CROFT Image caption Bomber crews often used Lincoln Cathedral as a landmark to guide them home Meanwhile Ben Ward who has followed Lincoln for 30 years said he thought the silence was probably fair enough given we have a large Eastern European/Ukrainian component to the population in Lincoln who will likely be on edge. He added: I think there\s been a massive overreaction to these two things. I don\t think missing a siren for four games is a decision that\s killing the club. The Dambusters 617 Squadron famously flew Lancaster bombers from RAF Scampton to destroy dams in Germanys Ruhr Valley during World War Two. Many bomber crews used Lincoln Cathedral as a landmark to let them know they had returned home safely. Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook Twitter and Instagram.

Homes for Ukraine: These people did not ask for war,Jacquie Clayton has welcomed two sisters into her house under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.,Homes for Ukraine: These people did not ask for war Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE JACQUIE CLAYTON Image caption Svitlana (left) and Yulia (right) have been welcomed into Jacquie Claytons Edinburgh home A woman who flew to Poland to help refugees fleeing Ukraine has welcomed two sisters from the war torn country into her Edinburgh home. Jacquie Clayton travelled to Krakow to help out in a soup kitchen as the humanitarian crisis unfolded. There she witnessed absolutely heart-breaking scenes which convinced her to join the Homes for Ukraine scheme. And on Sunday Svitlana and Yulia Derkach arrived in Scotland to stay with Ms Clayton and her husband Colin. So far 2700 visas have been issued for refugees coming to the UK as part of the initiative - fewer than 10% of the 28300 applications made in the schemes first 15 days. Ms Clayton had been critical of the bureaucracy faced by applicants but she told BBC Scotland of her relief that Svitlana 25 and 18-year-old Yulia were finally safe. The sisters are originally from Zhytomyr a city about 120km (75 miles) west of Kyiv. They were both based in the Ukrainian capital when the Russian invasion was launched on 24 February. But their parents have stayed behind to look after elderly relatives despite the region coming under heavy bombardment. Homes for Ukraine: 2700 visas issued government reveals How to sponsor Ukrainian refugees How many people have fled Ukraine? After Ms Clayton signed up for the scheme Svitlana got in touch with her and they built up a rapport on WhatsApp. She shared pictures of her family home and Edinburgh before they met for the first time. And Ms Clayton hopes others with spare rooms in their home will do the same. She said: I think we have seen enough on TV. These people did not ask for war. This should never have happened in the 21st century. All they are looking for is sanctuary and safety. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Intense daily bombing has left many of Zhytomyrs residents homeless Svitlana believes she has found both in Scotland. She said: We are very relieved. We are happy we are safe now and our parents don\t have to worry about our safety. Svitlana was working as a paralegal when Russia launched the invasion that she never imagined was possible. She said: It was really a shock to wake up from my father\s call at 5am to say: \The war has started. Pack your things and get out of the city\. It was really hard to stay in Kyiv and very dangerous. She also had to endure the fear and uncertainty of what was unfolding in her home region where school buildings and key infrastructure have been destroyed. Since the weekend Svitlana has been overwhelmed by the welcome her and her sister have received from the Clayton family. She said: We are very happy and very lucky. I did not expect such kindness from strange people I met on the internet. Their support is unbelievable. IMAGE SOURCE DERKACH FAMILY Image caption Svitlana and Yulia Derkach with their parents in Ukraine Yulia was studying geography and English at a university in Kyiv when the conflict started. She admitted the experience of moving to a new country at a time of great uncertainty in her homeland had been stressful. But Yulia added: The moment I saw our sponsors I felt really relieved because they met us with such warmth and love and I did not expect this. Ms Clayton hopes the young women will become lifelong friends and that she will be able to one day visit them in Ukraine. In the meantime she is showing them around Edinburgh. And next week they will attend a concert by singer-songwriter Jack Savoretti at the citys Usher Hall. Ms Clayton said: I want them to have as normal a life as possible while they are here.

"Ukraine war to halve global trade growth, warns WTO",The World Trade Organisation says ongoing pandemic-related supply chain problems are also hurting growth.,Ukraine war to halve global trade growth warns WTO By Jonathan Josephs Business reporter BBC News Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption The WTOs director general Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is worried that a food crisis is brewing The Ukraine war has led the World Trade Organization (WTO) to cut its global trade growth forecast for this year. The previous 4.7% growth forecast has been cut to 2.5% due to the impact of the war and related policies said WTO boss Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. The cut is also linked to continuing global supply chain problems that started as a result of the pandemic. She said disruptions would make food more costly saying my worry is that we have a food crisis that is brewing. Dr Okonjo-Iweala told the BBC that although Russia and Ukraine only make up about 2.5% of global merchandise exports they are very very significant in certain sectors. The first worry of course is for the people of Ukraine who are being displaced and] not having enough food to eat she said. Ukraine war could hit global growth OECD warns Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices The economic cost of Chinas zero-Covid policy She added the global economy was going to suffer some severe consequences and said poorer countries would particularly feel the impact of the shortages and the supply constraints on food. Supplies of many food products including wheat and corn have been affected following Russias invasion of Ukraine. Industry groups have warned the EU faces a shortage of sunflower oil. In total 46.9% of global exports come from Ukraine and 29.9% from Russia according to S&P Global but with Ukraines ports closed it is struggling to export it. I\m truly worried about looming hunger particularly in poor countries that can least afford it Dr Okonjo-Iweala warned. Using Africa as an example the former Nigerian finance minister said 35 of 55 countries there imported wheat and other grains from Russia and Ukraine and 22 imported fertiliser. Work being done by the African Development Bank now shows that in many countries food prices are rising by 20% to 50% already she said. However Dr Okonjo-Iweala said she was hopeful there were solutions to the supply problems. She said in the short term countries could be changing our dietary tastes to eat more homegrown products. She added in the longer term Africa was investing in heat tolerant varieties of wheat and other crops as it adapts to climate change. Media caption Watch: Ros Atkins on why the war in Ukraine is pushing up food prices - and the likely impact on poorer countries As well as food prices surging the cost of other commodities have hit record highs amid concerns the war and economic sanctions on Russia will lead to supply disruptions. Russias mining industry is hugely important for many substances such as palladium where it is responsible for 40% of global production of the metal that is essential for carmakers. Even before the war in Ukraine the pandemic had caused a mismatch between supply and demand in many industries which pushed prices up and the International Monetary Fund has warned that soaring inflation will reduce global economic growth this year. In the short to medium term I think that we are going to see these inflationary pressures continue Dr Okonjo-Iweala said. Trade battle with Russia Trade has become a key tool many countries have used to pressure President Vladimir Putin over his decision to invade Ukraine. Ukraine has cut economic ties with Russia and led calls for it to be suspended from the WTO because of the war. However no country has ever been expelled from the WTO something the Director-General said is not an easy thing to do. She says there is no mechanism to kick Russia out despite some leading international trade lawyers disagreeing. You can watch Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala\s full interview on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst this weekend. Viewers in the UK can watch the show on Sunday at 15:30 on the BBC News Channel. In other countries it will be on BBC World News at Saturday at 23:30 GMT Sunday at 05:30 & 16:30 GMT and Monday at 07:30 & 16:30 GMT]
Homes for Ukraine: Visas for 210 Ukrainians to flee to Scotland,"With more than four million people displaced by war, Nicola Sturgeon says the figure is ""woefully small""",Homes for Ukraine: Visas for 210 Ukrainians to flee to Scotland Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Visas have been issued for 210 Ukrainians to travel to Scotland under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. About 32200 applications have been made to the UK government scheme which is open to refugees with a named sponsor. However with more than four million Ukrainians displaced by war the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the figure was woefully small. The UK government said applications were processed as quickly as possible. Since the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme launched on 14 March a total of 4700 visas - less than 15% of applications - have been issued in the UK. Another 24000 visas - about 75% of the 32800 applications - have been issued to Ukrainians with family in the UK under a separate scheme. Refugee host: These people did not ask for war How can I offer a UK home to Ukrainian refugees? Super sponsor scheme opens for Ukrainian refugees The aim of Homes for Ukraine was to allow individuals charities community groups and other organisations to sponsor refugees housing them in their homes or buildings. The Scottish government said it wanted to be a super sponsor of Ukrainian refugees and vowed to provide people fleeing the war with temporary accommodation until a longer-term place can be found. A total 210 visas have been issued through the scheme so far - 180 visas to those who had an individual sponsor in Scotland and 30 who had applied to be sponsored through the Scottish governments super sponsor initiative. Woefully small number of visas granted Speaking after the new figures were published on Friday Nicola Sturgeon said the figure isn\t good enough. The process of translating applications into visas is unacceptably slow she added. The UK government is letting the people of Ukraine down and also letting down people across Scotland who have opened their homes. The UK requires the refugees to have a visa before they enter unlike other European countries which have waived the checks to speed things up. Ms Sturgeon added: It is neither reasonable nor morally acceptable to expect people fleeing a brutal invasion to go through the bureaucratic processes being put in their way and wait weeks to be given a visa. We have called for the need for visas to be waived by the UK government] so displaced people could immediately reach a place of safety just as our European neighbours have done. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES A spokesman for the UK government said: We are moving as quickly as possible to ensure that those fleeing Ukraine can find safety in the UK through the Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine. We have streamlined the process so valid passport holders do not have to attend in-person appointments before arriving in the UK simplified our forms and boosted caseworker numbers while ensuring vital security checks are carried out. We continue to speed up visa processing across both schemes with over 29000 visas issued in the last three weeks alone and thousands more expected to come through these uncapped routes. The UN refugee agency said more than four million refugees have now fled Ukraine since Russia launched its war in the biggest refugee crisis since World War Two.

War in Ukraine: Russia accuses Ukraine of attacking oil depot,"Russia claims a Ukrainian helicopter raid set fuel tanks ablaze in Belgorod, a Russian city.",War in Ukraine: Russia accuses Ukraine of attacking oil depot Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Media caption WATCH: Firefighters tackle a blaze at an oil storage depot in Belgorod which Russia says was attacked An oil storage depot was set on fire in a Russian city just north of Ukraine after what Russia described as an attack by two Ukrainian helicopters. A video shared on Twitter showed a blaze near apartment blocks in Belgorod 40km (25 miles) from the border. Some clips appeared to show rockets hitting the oil depot. Ukraines top security official however denied Ukrainian forces were behind the attack. For some reason they are saying we are behind it. This does not correspond to reality security council secretary Oleksiy Danilov said. Ukrainian aircraft have not struck targets in Russia previously. Yet Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov accused Ukraine of launching the attack and later Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov gave details. He said that at around 05:00 Moscow time (02:00 GMT) two Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopters entered Russian airspace at extremely low altitude and launched a missile attack on a civilian oil storage facility on the outskirts of Belgorod. Some storage tanks were damaged and caught fire he said. The oil storage facility has nothing to do with the Russian armed forces he said. President Vladimir Putin\s spokesman said the incident cannot be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for continuing the talks with Kyiv. So far those peace talks have made little progress. The spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was now trying to reorganise the fuel supply chain to prevent disruption of Belgorods energy supplies. The city of 370000 lies just north of Ukraines second city Kharkiv which has been heavily shelled by Russian artillery and remains surrounded by Russian forces. Governor Gladkov said in a Telegram message that nobody was killed at the oil depot which is run by Russian state oil firm Rosneft. He said emergency workers were trying to contain the fire and there was no threat to residents. The emergencies ministry posted video of the blaze on Telegram. Russias Interfax news agency reported that residents nearby were evacuated and two people were injured at the depot. It said eight fuel tanks were on fire and nearly 200 firefighters were on the scene. Queues of cars later formed at local petrol stations but Mr Gladkov said Belgorods fuel supplies were still plentiful. Russias RIA Novosti news agency says the blaze in three of the tanks has been extinguished but there is still a risk of the fire spreading. On 29 March several explosions were reported at an ammunition depot near Belgorod. Commenting on the oil depot blaze Ukrainian defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said Russian aggression was being resisted on the territory of Ukraine. It does not mean that Ukraine has to bear responsibility for all those catastrophes and all those events that happen on the territory of the Russian Federation. This is not the first time we have seen such accusations. So dear friends I will neither confirm nor deny this information he said. Ukraine is yet to claim responsibility for this attack but if it were confirmed it would be the first time that Ukrainian aircraft have flown into Russian airspace to hit a target. bringing the war home to Russia. Ukrainian helicopter pilots have plenty of experience of flying low and fast to avoid being detected by military radar and air defence systems. Theyve been doing exactly that in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine for years. I experienced and witnessed the extraordinary skills of the Ukrainian military pilots in 2018 - flying barely metres above the tree line and telegraph poles. But if these unconfirmed reports are correct - flying at night well into Russian territory to launch an attack on an enemy fuel depot would have required extraordinary bravery - as well as finely-honed flying skills. Low-flying helicopters are still vulnerable to short-range air defence systems. Flying at night would have lessened that risk but heightened the danger of hitting an object near the ground. The Mi-24 or Hind helicopter is known as the flying tank. Its rockets would have been the weapon deployed to target the oil depot in Belgorod Russia. This alleged attack alone will not dramatically alter the battle. But it could show Ukraine has managed to keep its air force functioning and give a huge boost to the morale of Ukraines military. A well-known Ukrainian journalist in Kyiv Yury Butusov posted on Facebook that it was a missile attack at 05:50 local time (02:50 GMT) by two Ukrainian Mi-24 combat helicopters which flew from Ukraine to Russian Belgorod over low altitudes inconspicuous for Russian anti-aircraft defence. Vladimir Soloviev host of a staunchly pro-Kremlin current affairs programme on Russian state TV asked in a tweet: Question. Who is in charge of the Belgorod air defences? Have the bases of the helicopters that delivered this strike been destroyed? When will a safe zone be set up in Belgorod region?

Ukraine: GCHQ chief warns China over 'alignment' with Russia,Beijing is told its interests will not be served by an alliance with Moscow after Ukraine invasion.,Ukraine: GCHQ chief warns China over alignment with Russia Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping at a meeting in Brazil in 2019 China should not become too closely aligned with Russia following the invasion of Ukraine the head of UK cyber-intelligence GCHQ has warned. Sir Jeremy Fleming said Chinas long-term interests are not served by an alliance with Moscow. In a rare public address during a visit to Australia Sir Jeremy also said Russia had massively misjudged the situation in Ukraine. He said Vladimir Putin\s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth. Putin advisers too scared to tell him truth - US US warns China against helping Russia in Ukraine Ukraine War: Putin demands Mariupol surrender to end shelling Why has Putin invaded? Sir Jeremy said China\s aspirations to become a leading player on the global stage were not well served by close alliance with a regime that wilfully and illegally ignores international rules. The speech at the Australian National University in Canberra comes after Downing Street said Boris Johnson had a frank and candid discussion with China\s President Xi Jinping last week. Sir Jeremy said that Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a clear strategic choice to align with China as it grows more powerful in opposition to the United States. He said the Kremlin regards China in the current crisis as a supplier of weapons technology and a potential market for its oil and gas. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption GCHQ Director Jeremy Fleming was speaking in Australia But Sir Jeremy suggested President Xi has a more nuanced view of the relationship. Russia understands that long term China will become increasingly strong militarily and economically. Some of their interests conflict; Russia could be squeezed out of the equation. Meanwhile echoing comments from US and Ukrainian officials the GCHQ boss said Mr Putin underestimated the strength of the coalition his actions would galvanise. He under-played the economic consequences of the sanctions regime. He over-estimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory. However Sir Jeremy said the extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime.

Ukraine round-up: Little progress in peace talks as shelling continues,"No breakthrough, says Russia, while Ukraine says Russia has broken a promise to pull back troops.",Ukraine round-up: Little progress in peace talks as shelling continues Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption Chernihiv has no electricity water supply or heat the regional governor told the BBC A quarter of Ukraines people have fled their homes in the 35 days since the war began. And despite high hopes peace talks in Istanbul have reportedly failed to provide even a respite in the fighting let alone a breakthrough. Both sides are in Turkey for the talks with high expectations set on Tuesday. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has since said that while the Ukraine side had set out proposals on paper there was nothing promising in terms of signs of a breakthrough. Ukraine said it could become a neutral state - with security guarantees - to assuage Russias fears it might join the Western military alliance Nato. But Russia dismissed Ukraines proposal for talks about Crimea which Russia annexed by military means in 2014. And as the talks went on officials in Ukraine said there had been no let-up in attacks on the northern city of Chernihiv despite a Russian pledge to reduce military activity there. The governor of the Chernihiv region Viacheslav Chaus told the BBC that the city had experienced a tense night while residents said shelling had continued into Wednesday.

A quarter of Ukrainians have fled their homes IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Refugees wait at a temporary shelter in Poland More than four million people have now fled Ukraine to escape Russias invasion and more than six million are displaced inside the country according to the latest United Nations figures. That means at least a quarter of the population have had to abandon their homes because of the war. Its the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two - Poland alone has received 2.3 million Ukrainian refugees. The BBCs Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says there can be no quick fix to such a major humanitarian crisis. Europes unity and generosity will be needed not for weeks but possibly years she adds. Putin demands Mariupol surrender to end shelling Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that shelling of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol will only end when Ukrainian troops surrender. Mr Putin made the comments during an hour-long phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday night the Kremlin said in a statement. But French officials said the Russian leader had agreed to consider plans to evacuate civilians from the city. It comes as new satellite photos showed the destruction caused by the shelling. The images released by the Earth observation company Maxar showed that residential areas have been reduced to rubble and highlighted Russian artillery cannons in firing positions on the outskirts of the city. IMAGE SOURCE MAXAR How are Russians getting news about the war in Ukraine? IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Marina Ovsyannikova an editor at state-controlled Channel 1 was detained after she ran onto a news set holding a sign saying no war The situation in Russias media is unprecedented. Restrictions on reporting are increasingly severe and access to almost all independent outlets is blocked or limited - or they censor themselves. For most Russians television remains the main source of the news. It is firmly controlled by the Kremlin and pumps out relentless pro-war propaganda. Ukrainians are said to shell their own cities and Russian troops are presented as liberators. There is more variety of opinion in the print press but it still largely sticks to the Kremlin line. The independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta suspended operations on 28 March after receiving warnings from Russias media watchdog Roskomnadzor. But while many independent online outlets are blocked restrictions are relatively easy to get around for internet-savvy Russians familiar with tools like virtual private networks (VPNs). The Meduza and Mediazona websites operate from outside Russia and staff have told authorities in Moscow that they will not silence us. Read more about the Russias war-time media landscape here. The Syrians signing up to fight for Putin Media caption Watch: The Syrians signing up to fight for Russia Russia says it has signed up some 16000 recruits from the Middle East to fight with its forces in Ukraine and social media in Syria has been flooded with requests for people to join Russian troops in return for up to $7000 (£5330). One former Syrian regime soldier who has been offered thousands of dollars to fight in the war told BBC News Arabic that his countrys broken economy means hundreds of Syrians are putting themselves forward.

"Scotland-Ukraine World Cup game likely to go ahead, expert says",Some of Ukraine's top players have now been allowed to leave the country ahead of the match in June.,Scotland-Ukraine World Cup game likely to go ahead expert says Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Ukraine are bidding to reach their second mens World Cup finals It is increasingly likely that Scotlands World Cup qualifier against Ukraine will go ahead in June a Ukrainian football expert has said. The match had been due to be played at Hampden last week with the winner then playing Wales for a place in the tournament in Qatar later this year. It was rescheduled for June after Russia invaded but there have been fears Ukraine would not be able play. Journalist Andrew Todos said he believed the game would go ahead. Many of Ukraines top international players play in their domestic league and all men aged between 18-60 had been banned from leaving the country under its martial law rules. However Mr Todos told BBC Radio Scotlands Lunchtime Live programme that players from Dynamo Kiev - one of Ukraines biggest clubs - had now been given special permission by the ministry of sport to play friendly matches outside of the country. Not yet qualified but Scots await World Cup draw Scotland v Ukraine postponed The Ukrainian football expert said: Over the next few weeks or couple of months they\ll be playing - apparently - against sides such as Legia Warsaw Steaua Bucharest Paris Saint-Germain and some other sides have agreed in principle to play them and raise money for the Ukraine humanitarian aid. The fact that the team has been allowed to leave - I think there\s growing optimism that the Ukraine national team will be allowed to convene outside of Ukraine in the next month or so. The Scottish Football Supporters Association (SFSA) launched a petition last month calling for Ukraine to be allowed to qualify automatically for the World Cup without having to play any more matches. Its chairman Andy Smith said FIFA - which has already kicked Russia out of the tournament - had an opportunity to do the right thing even if it meant making it harder for Scotland to qualify. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Ukraine coach Oleksandr Petrakov is trying to set up a training camp for his team ahead of the match with Scotland Mr Todos said the Ukrainian squad was keen to qualify for the tournament by winning on the pitch. He said: The Ukraine captain has already said as long as we\ve got arms and legs we want to finish this on the pitch - we\ll let our soldiers do what they\re doing on the battlefield and we can do this for them. I think the logistics are in place for them to get the kit out to get the training staff out. All that remains is to work out where Ukraine will be based the few weeks before the match starts. Scotland coach Steve Clarke said last week that it was difficult to see the game being played in June because of the war. He said: It\s not just the fixture it\s the fact they need to get together have a training camp and get all their players on the pitch with a proper period of time to prepare for such an important game. His Ukrainian counterpart Oleksandr Petrakov has told the Guardian that he was trying to arrange a training camp for his players outside of the country possibly in the UK ahead of the match. He said his team - many of whom have been unable to play or train since the invasion - would need to play five or six practice matches to return to full fitness without which it would be very hard to get to play with Scotland. Both Scotland and Ukraine will be included in Fridays World Cup draw despite neither having yet qualified for the tournament which will be played in November. Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war]

People in Goudhurst are working together to bring them to the UK under the Home Office scheme to house refugees fleeing the war with Russia. The work is being aided by one of the Kent villagers who is Ukrainian and who has helped translate forms. Vika Gallacher said the Ukrainian families are incredibly touched and so grateful for this opportunity to be safe as Russian bombardments continue. One villager Jill Andrew has been video-calling a woman Anna who has fled to Poland with her mother and young son. The family will stay with her when they eventually reach Kent. Image caption The villagers of Goudhurst have been video-calling some of the Ukrainians they plan to welcome into their homes Ms Andrew said: The stories she tells living in basements for 10 days and then finally making it to safety but not being able to help family and friends who are still left behind it just brings home the reality of what\s happening to these people. On a recent video call Anna said: We don\t want anything except to survive to survive for our children and relatives. Jobs and a support network for the refugees have already been lined up ahead of their arrival which is expected in the coming days. Image caption Ukrainian Vika Gallacher lives in Goudhurst and has been helping with translations Alison Webster from Goudhurst Parish Council praised the villages community effort. She said: Seeing the TV pictures of what\s happening in Ukraine I think it\s really touched the hearts of the villagers and it\s such a small village.

Ukraine conflict: Russia to allow unauthorised imports from West,The decision is in response to Western sanctions and surging inflation since the war in Ukraine.,Ukraine conflict: Russia to allow unauthorised imports from West Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Russias prime minister said he wanted to saturate the market to create fast access to essential goods Russia is allowing imports without a trademark owners permission in reaction to sanctions that have halted an array of Western products. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin approved parallel imports as part of a fourth package of support for small and medium-sized businesses. The Wests response to Russias war has prompted a surge in inflation. The prime minister said until now goods could not be sold in Russia without the trademark owners authorisation. The aim of letting retailers import products without the companies\ permission he explained was to saturate the market so that people had fast access to necessary goods guaranteeing supply despite the unfriendly actions of foreign politicians. Lists of products were to be co-ordinated with the ministry of industry and trade Mr Mishustin said in a televised address. Russian reports indicate they will focus on consumer products where prices have risen. Annual inflation has soared this week to 15.66%. Sugar in particular has been hit by price rises and shortages and Russias anti-monopoly service said it was investigating the countrys five biggest producers. In a bid to prop up the currency Russia announced last week that unfriendly countries would have to pay for their natural gas in roubles from Thursday. The EU has rejected the idea and Germany said Chancellor Olaf Scholz had been told that Europe would be able to continue paying in euros to a Russian bank not under sanctions which would then convert the money into roubles. Hundreds of global brands such as Apple and H&M have also either pulled out of the Russian market or halted sales since the invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February. Several companies have continued to provide basic nutrition and hygiene items. Sports shop Decathlon said this week it was only closing its shops because of supply chain problems while Nestle has suspended the sale of the vast majority of volume and sales in Russia. In a separate development Russian state institutions have been barred from buying foreign software from Thursday for so-called critical information infrastructure without prior government consent. The decree covers telecom and information systems used by government agencies as well as companies in defence healthcare transport energy and finance.

Yorkshire-built armoured ambulances bound for Ukraine,The former British Army vehicles are being converted to support medics in the war-torn country.,Yorkshire-built armoured ambulances bound for Ukraine Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption Former British Army vehicles are being transformed at two factories in West and East Yorkshire Ex-British Army vehicles are being converted in Yorkshire into armoured ambulances for medics in Ukraine. Manufacturer Venari Group said it was transforming dozens of vehicles at its two factories in Goole and Brighouse. Ukraine is currently losing ambulances at an increasingly rapid rate of 10 per day the company said. Andrew Percy Conservative MP for Brigg and Goole said he was so proud that staff in his constituency were working round the clock on the project. The firm said the military-grade ambulances were designed to carry greater numbers of casualties and would provide ballistic protection from small arms fire on the front line. A spokesperson said: With all-terrain capability they will allow increased manoeuvrability for both paramedics and patients and allow medical teams to treat people who they may not otherwise be able to reach. Image caption The new ambulances are designed to carry greater numbers of casualties the firm says Venari Group CEO Oliver North said his staff were working 24 hours a day - throughout the weekend - to speed-up production time after being contacted by Mr Percy and staff at the Ukrainian embassy. As the UK\s oldest and largest ambulance builder we truly feel it is our duty to deliver on this project with as much passion precision and speed as we possibly can he said. Mr Percy said: Their efforts have been amazing and they should all be very proud of what they are doing to keep medical professionals and patients in Ukraine safe. Funding for the project has come from a number of wealthy Ukrainian businessmen and UK-based blue chip organisations.

Ukraine war: Northern Ireland advice centres to open for refugees,"The four drop-in centres will provide refugees with help on health, education and employment issues.",Ukraine war: Northern Ireland advice centres to open for refugees By Mark Simpson BBC News NI Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES/WOJTEK RADWANSKI Image caption There are no official figures for the number of Ukrainians who have come to Northern Ireland since the Russian invasion began in February Four advice centres are to be opened in Northern Ireland to help the hundreds of refugees who have arrived from Ukraine. The drop-in centres will provide help on health education and employment issues. They will be set up in Belfast Ballymena Craigavon and Newry. There are no official figures for the number of Ukrainians who have come to Northern Ireland since the Russian invasion began back in February. It is estimated that several hundred have arrived already. Most of them came to stay with relatives but Stormont officials say 40 visas have been issued in recent days under the Homes for Ukraine scheme to refugees who say they intend to come to Northern Ireland. Anyone in the UK who takes in a refugee will be entitled to a payment of £350 a month. Unprecedented task to help Ukrainian refugees How can Ukrainian refugees come to the UK? Those who take part in the scheme must commit to providing accommodation for at least six months. Since the scheme opened last month more than 7000 people in Northern Ireland have registered an interest. Ukrainians coming to Northern Ireland are entitled to free public transport as soon as they arrive for their journey to their final destination. Refugees will be asked to produce their passport of Ukrainian government ID for free travel on buses or trains. It is estimated that around 600 Ukrainians were living in Northern Ireland before the war broke out.]
Why has Russia invaded Ukraine and what does Putin want?,"Weeks after Russia's leader unleashed war on Ukraine, there is no sign yet of when it will end.",Why has Russia invaded Ukraine and what does Putin want? By Paul Kirby BBC News Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Media caption Drone footage shows the extent of destruction in cities across Ukraine since the start of the war When Vladimir Putin shattered the peace in Europe by unleashing war on a democracy of 44 million people his justification was that modern Western-leaning Ukraine was a constant threat and Russia could not feel safe develop and exist. But after five weeks of bombardment thousands of deaths in ruined cities and the displacement of more than 10 million people inside Ukraine and beyond the questions remain: what is his aim and is there a way out? What was Putins goal? The Russian leaders initial aim was to overrun Ukraine and depose its government ending for good its desire to join the Western defensive alliance Nato. But the invasion has become bogged down and he appears to have scaled back his ambitions. Launching the invasion on 24 February he told the Russian people his goal was to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine to protect people subjected to what he called eight years of bullying and genocide by Ukraine\s government. It is not our plan to occupy the Ukrainian territory. We do not intend to impose anything on anyone by force he insisted. This was not even a war or invasion he claimed merely the fiction of a special military operation that Russian state-controlled media are required to adopt. The claims of Nazis and genocide in Ukraine were completely unfounded but it was clear Russia saw this as a pivotal moment. Russia\s future and its future place in the world are at stake said foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin. Russias military aimed to sweep into the capital Kyiv invading from Belarus in the north as well as from the south and east. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke of freeing Ukraine from oppression while Ukraine\s democratically elected President Volodymyr Zelensky said the enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two. But Ukraines fierce resistance has caused heavy losses and in some areas driven Russian forces back. Has Putin changed his aims? Russia does appear to have lowered its ambitions claiming it has generally accomplished the aims of the invasion\s first phase which it defined as considerably reducing Ukraine\s combat potential. Russia announced at peace talks that it would be drastically reducing its military operations around the capital and around the northern city of Chernihiv. That is yet to be confirmed and Ukraines President Zelensky has said Ukraine can only trust concrete results not words. The war continues particularly in the east and the south where Russian forces are trying to create a land corridor along the south coast east from Crimea to the Russian border. A month into the invasion Russia declared its main goal was the liberation of Donbas - broadly referring to Ukraine\s eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. More than a third of this area was already seized by Russian-backed separatists in a war that began in 2014. Ahead of the invasion it was clear President Putin wanted all of the east recognising the whole area as belonging to two Russian puppet statelets. The head of the Luhansk statelet has suggested holding a referendum on joining Russia similar to an internationally discredited vote held in Crimea in 2014. Beyond his military goals President Putins broader demand is to ensure Ukraines future neutrality. The Ukrainians have offered that in return for security guarantees from allies as part of a wide-ranging peace plan presented in talks in Turkey. Why Putin wants a neutral Ukraine Since Ukraine achieved independence in 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed it has gradually veered towards the West - both the EU and Nato. Russia\s leader has sought to reverse that seeing the fall of the Soviet Union as the disintegration of historical Russia. He has claimed Russians and Ukrainians are one people and denied Ukraine its long history: Ukraine never had stable traditions of genuine statehood he asserted. It was his pressure on Ukraines pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych not to sign a deal with the European Union in 2013 that led to protests that ultimately ousted the Ukrainian president in February 2014. Russia then seized Ukraines southern region of Crimea and triggered a separatist rebellion in the east and a war that claimed 14000 lives. As he prepared to invade in February he tore up an unfulfilled 2015 Minsk peace deal and accused Nato of threatening our historic future as a nation claiming without foundation that Nato countries wanted to bring war to Crimea. What would neutrality look like? Before Ukraine presented its plans Russia said it was considering a neutral demilitarised Ukraine with its own army and navy along the lines of Austria or Sweden which are both EU members. Austria is neutral while Sweden is non-aligned. President Zelensky had already declared that Ukrainians now understood they would will not be admitted to Nato: It\s a truth and it must be recognised. EPA/Ukraine presidency Security guarantees and neutrality the non-nuclear status of our state - we are ready to go for it... If I remember correctly this is why Russia] started the war Volodymyr Zelensky President of Ukraine Russia does not see Ukraines peace proposals as either promising or a breakthrough so the war will continue. But this is Kyivs offer: Ukraine would become a non-bloc (or non-aligned) and non-nuclear state with no foreign military bases or contingents on its territory Strict legally binding guarantees would require countries such as the UK China the USA Turkey France Canada Italy Poland and Israel to protect a neutral Ukraine in the event of attack Within three days guarantor states would have to hold consultations and come to Ukraines defence Ukraine would be allowed to join the European Union Ukraine would not enter military-political alliances and any international exercises would require consent of guarantor states. Ukraines bid to join Nato (and the EU) is enshrined in its 2019 constitution so any change would require a referendum some months later. What about Crimea and the east? Russia is so far unimpressed with Ukraines plan for the future status of Crimea seized by Russia in 2014 to be decided during 15 years of consultations. The Kremlin says Crimea is now Russian territory and the Russian constitution bars discussing its status with anyone else. As part of Kyivs peace proposals all Russian troops would leave Ukrainian territory and the future of the eastern areas held by Russian-backed separatists would be discussed by the two presidents as part of a ceasefire summit. However President Putin will not wish to abandon any territorial gains made during the war especially as the declared aim is liberating Ukraine\s east. Kyiv meanwhile will never agree to ceding its sovereign territory. Ukraine has never taken seriously Russia\s demand for militarisation and Moscow\s insistence on de-Nazification is merely Russian propaganda. In the words of Ukraine\s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba: It\s crazy sometimes not even they can explain what they are referring to. President Zelensky has said he is prepared to give Russian minority language status along with the languages of other neighbouring countries and does not see this as a major issue. Whats Putins problem with Nato? For Russias leader the Wests 30-member defensive military alliance has one aim - to split society in Russia and ultimately destroy it. Ahead of the war he demanded that Nato turn the clock back to 1997 and reverse its eastward expansion removing its forces and military infrastructure from member states that joined the alliance from 1997 and not deploying strike weapons near Russia\s borders. That means Central Europe Eastern Europe and the Baltics. In President Putin\s eyes the West promised back in 1990 that Nato would expand not an inch to the east but did so anyway. That was before the collapse of the Soviet Union however so the promise made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev only referred to East Germany in the context of a reunified Germany. Mr Gorbachev said later that the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed at the time. Does Putin have designs beyond Ukraine? If he has his military setbacks in Ukraine may have put paid to any wider ambitions beyond Ukraine. After hours of conversations with Russia\s authoritarian leader German Chancellor Olaf Scholz concluded: Putin wants to build a Russian empire... He wants to fundamentally redefine the status quo within Europe in line with his own vision. And he has no qualms about using military force to do so. Tatiana Stanovaya of analysis firm RPolitik and the Carnegie Moscow Center fears a spiral in a new Cold War confrontation: I have very firm feelings that we should get prepared for a new ultimatum to the West which will be more militarised and aggressive than we could have imagined. Having witnessed Mr Putins willingness to lay waste European cities to achieve his aims Western leaders are now under no illusion. President Joe Biden has labelled him a war criminal and the leaders of both Germany and France see this war as a turning point in the history of Europe. Before the war Russia demanded all US nuclear arms be barred from beyond their national territories. The US had offered to start talks on limiting short- and medium-range missiles as well as on a new treaty on intercontinental missiles but there is little chance of that happening for now.

READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis What next for Russia itself? President Putin has been stunned by the scale of the Western response to his invasion. He knew Natos members would never put boots on the ground in Ukraine but he could not have guessed the extent of the sanctions that are already having a dramatic effect on Russias economy - and he is furious. The EU US UK and other Western nations have targeted Russias economy in a variety of ways: Russias central bank has had its assets frozen and major banks are shut out of the international SWIFT payment transfer network. The US has banned imports of Russian oil and gas; the EU aims to cut gas imports by two-thirds within a year; and the UK aims to phase out Russian oil by the end of 2022 Germany has halted approval on Russias Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline a major investment by both Russia and European companies Russian airlines have been barred from airspace over the EU UK US and Canada Personal sanctions have been imposed on President Putin Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and many other individuals No peace deal with Ukraine will bring these sanctions to an end and Vladimir Putin knows that. Instead he has turned on Russians who have opposed the war. The Russian people will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors said Russia\s president. More than 15100 anti-war protesters have been detained and virtually all independent media have been silenced. There is no meaningful political opposition left as they have either fled the country or in the case of opposition leader Alexei Navalny jailed for years in a strict-regime penal colony.]

Clare Maddox nervously asked her daughter Sophia as they waited by the arrivals gates at Stansted Airport. They were looking out for a mother and daughter - two refugees who were among the first to arrive in the UK under the government\s Homes for Ukraine scheme. It had been 11 years since they last saw Diana Sachavo in the flesh. Shed visited the UK aged 10. Diana had come over with the help of the charity Chernobyl Childrens Lifeline and stayed with the Clare and Sophia at their house in Billericay Essex. Afterwards theyd stayed in touch. Now she was returning - alongside her mother - this time as a refugee. I\m so glad you are here Clare told them as she was introduced to Diana\s mum Olena for the first time. Their flight from Lithuania had just landed and Clare tearfully hugged both women not letting them go. 100000 sign up to UKs refugee site in first day Homes for Ukraine: Its sad slow and frustrating 2700 visas issued through Homes for Ukraine Diana and Olena had to leave their home in the town of Irpin. It has been heavily bombed by Russia. They first travelled to Ukraines capital Kyiv then to the western city of Lviv before fleeing for Poland then Lithuania. They arrived in the UK as part of the Homes for Ukraine scheme which launched two weeks ago. Yet latest figures suggest they are among the lucky ones. Just 2700 visas have so far been granted under the scheme. The number of applications has already passed 28000. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Diana and Olenas home town Irpin has suffered heavy Russian bombardment As part of the scheme Ukrainian families who are escaping the war - like the Sachavos - can come to the UK for up to three years and receive access to healthcare and benefits provided a named individual agrees to put them up for a minimum of six months. Those with citizenship or settled status are able to bring their family over to stay under a separate Home Office scheme. I think they are very brave making that really terrifying journey Clare told the BBC. I can\t tell them how incredibly sad I am that they have had to make that journey. Hopefully I can just make their lives a little bit better than they have just been experiencing. We had to find the courage to choose the safest moment for us to escape the shelling Olena added. I am safe and my daughter is safe and that is the main thing. I am extremely grateful to you Clare and to all the people who have been so kind to us. How can I offer a UK home to Ukrainian refugees? The refugee host family with all the love to give Yet most families who have registered for the scheme are still waiting for news. Many are increasingly frustrated at how slow the process is going. Garry Taylor a project manager from Southend-on-Sea made contact with Yuliia Chernovil and her seven-year-old daughter Alisa via social media a day after the UK scheme was launched. The mother and daughter had to flee the eastern region of Donetsk heading for Lviv.

But two weeks on his would-be guests are still stuck in Poland waiting for a passport for Alisa to be issued. The process hasn\t been thought through he says. It\s embarrassing having to ask every day: \Have you had any news on your visa\? You\ve got countries across Europe welcoming people with open arms. I\ve seen some leaflets in Poland saying: \Don\t worry about the formalities we\ll worry about those afterwards\. Yet you\ve got all of this red tape that we seem to have created here.

They have now had to make another appointment at the visa centre in Poland. Many hosts in England like Garry are getting much of their information from groups popping up on social media where there is still a steady stream of both people offering accommodation and those seeking a place to say. Some report frustration with the time it is taking to issue visas and the lack of updates. There are also reports of problems uploading documents to the schemes portal as Garry discovered. Scotland and Wales have taken a different approach acting as so-called super sponsors. This means any Ukrainian can apply without a named sponsor and they will initially be given temporary accommodation before a home is found for them. IMAGE SOURCE GARRY TAYLOR Image caption Garry Taylor pictured here with his family made contact with Yuliia via social media There has been criticism of the scheme since it was launched and charities have said the process in England is just too difficult for those fleeing Ukraine. They have called for the UK to stop requiring visas for those fleeing Ukraine. Downing Street meanwhile has said the Home Office has made the process quicker and easier - including making the visa form shorter and allowing valid passport holders to apply online and complete biometric checks in the UK. But refugees minister Lord Harrington acknowledged more needed to be done. We are starting to see progress because of changes the Home Office made to streamline the visa process and put additional resources into the system. However we need to do more and will be making further improvements to bring people to the UK as quickly as possible. I look forward to welcoming more families and ensuring they have the support they need when they arrive. Update: A short time after this story was published Yuliia and her daughter received the final documents they needed to be able to travel to the UK. Additional reporting by NJ Convery.]

Ukraine: Visa to bring family to Cumbria 'took most of the day',"Alla Stoica, who is originally from Kyiv, says getting her relatives to the UK is too complicated.",Ukraine: Visa to bring family to Cumbria took most of the day Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE ALLA STOICA Image caption Alla Stoica has experience of completing visa forms for her parents visits to the UK A Ukrainian woman living in the UK says trying to get visas for her relatives caught up in the war with Russia has been overly complicated and too slow. Alla Stoica from Carlisle Cumbria submitted applications for her sister-in-law and nephew in Kyiv nearly two weeks ago but has heard nothing since. It\s not straightforward at all the 40-year-old former nurse said of the government\s Ukraine Family Scheme. The Home Office said it was moving as quickly as possible. Ms Stoica who is originally from Kyiv but moved to Carlisle 16 years ago said: I\ve got a little bit of experience because the process is similar to applying for a tourist visa and I\ve applied for those for my parents in the past. But still to do two applications for my sister-in-law and my nephew it took most of the day.

Ms Stoica who is married to a local restaurant owner said she did not believe Russia\s pledge to reduce military action around the capital in order to boost mutual trust in peace talks. I don\t think anyone believes it] she said. She said any scaling down was due to Russian forces being pushed back by Ukrainian troops not because of negotiation. They know they\ve got no chance to take Kyiv she said. I spoke to my brother this morning and there was still heavy shelling and there were still explosions last night and the night before.

Ukraine war in maps: Tracking the Russian invasion,Counter-attacks by Ukrainian forces are successfully regaining territory as Russian forces refocus efforts on the east of the country.,Ukraine war in maps: Tracking the Russian invasion By The Visual Journalism Team BBC News Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Counter-attacks by Ukrainian forces are successfully regaining territory in several areas as Russian forces regroup and refocus their efforts on operations in the east of the country. Here are the latest developments on day 37 of the invasion: Ukrainian forces retaking key positions around Kyiv Shelling remains ongoing in Kyiv and in Chernihiv Russian troops said to be withdrawing from Chernobyl Port city of Mariupol remains likely to fall to Russia soon Ukrainian forces repelling Russian attacks in the Donbas Russia redeploying troops to Ukraine from Georgia Russia launched its attack on 24 February but five weeks into the war it is having to bolster its forces by redeploying troops from Georgia after suffering unexpected losses according to the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD). Ukrainian counter-attacks have pushed Russian troops back in a number of places and the MoD says that Russia is struggling to sustain its operations across multiple areas of engagement. Ukrainians fight back around Kyiv Russian forces have lost ground around Kyiv in recent days and they have moved from trying to encircle the capital to withdrawing to positions that are more easily defended according to Jack Watling a defence analyst at the Royal United Services Institute. Ukrainian forces have successfully pushed Russian troops back in a number of areas on the outskirts of Kyiv including in the suburb of Irpin about 20km (12 miles) to the west. These counter-attacks are pushing Russian artillery further out of range of central Kyiv but shelling of the suburbs has continued as Russian forces try to defend their positions. To the east of the capital Ukrainian forces have reclaimed ground from the Russians around the suburb of Brovary about 20km (12 miles) away from the centre of Kyiv. The Russian advance on Kyiv from the east has been hindered by the failure to take control of Chernihiv a major city to the north-east that sits between the capital and the Russian border. The aerial bombardment of Chernihiv has continued in recent days but analysts at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) say some Russian units are being withdrawn from around the city - and from around Kyiv Chernobyl and Sumy - to be redeployed in the east of the country.

FUEL: Could the world cope without Russian oil? READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Russian progress slows in the south Russian forces initially made rapid gains in the south with their main objective being the creation of a land corridor between Crimea which it annexed in 2014 and areas held by Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk. Standing in the way of that objective has been the port city of Mariupol which has been encircled by Russian forces since the start of March. Russian forces have been advancing further into the centre of Mariupol recently and the city is likely to fall within days according to the ISW. More than 100000 civilians are thought to be trapped in the besieged city and its deputy mayor says people there are dying from starvation and dehydration. To the west Russia had been attempting to push towards Odesa with the aim of cutting off Ukraines access to the Black Sea. But their advances stalled at Mykolaiv where a counter-attack by Ukrainian troops has pushed Russian forces back towards the city of Kherson. Russian troops in the area are now concentrating on maintaining their current positions rather than taking new ground according to the ISW. Russia targets full control in the east With recent setbacks elsewhere in the country Russian officials have said that the focus of its forces is now the complete liberation of the Donbas. The Donbas broadly refers to Ukraines eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before Russias invasion. Analysts says Russian forces in the region are trying to encircle Ukrainian troops there by advancing from Kharkiv to the north and Mariupol from the south. But Ukrainian forces have repelled several recent assaults particularly around the town of Rubizhne and Russian forces have failed to make any significant gains recently according to the ISW.

About these maps To indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the Institute for the Study of War with the American Enterprise Institutes Critical Threats Project. From 2 March this daily assessment differentiated between Assessed Russian-controlled Ukrainian territory and Assessed Russian advances in Ukraine the latter indicating areas where Russians are believed to have launched attacks from but which they do not control. To show key areas where advances are taking place we are also using daily updates from the UK Ministry of Defence and BBC research. The situation in Ukraine is fast moving and it is likely there will be times when there have been changes not reflected in the maps.

"Ukraine war: Russian troops leave Chernobyl, Ukraine says",Ukraine's state nuclear company says Russian soldiers have left the former nuclear power plant.,Ukraine war: Russian troops leave Chernobyl Ukraine says Published 2 days ago comments Comments Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption There have been concerns about safety at the former plant since the Russian occupation Russian troops occupying the former nuclear power plant at Chernobyl have left the plants staff say. According to Ukraine\s state nuclear company Energoatom staff at the plant said there are currently no outsiders at the site. Earlier it said some Russian forces had set off towards the Belarusian border leaving a small group behind. The announcement appears to confirm reports by senior US defence officials on Wednesday of a withdrawal. Russian troops seized Chernobyl at the beginning of their invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. This morning the invaders announced their intentions to leave the Chernobyl nuclear power plant Energoatom said in a statement on Thursday. The company later accused the Russian military of abducting members of the Ukrainian National Guard held captive since the start of the war. Energoatom sourced its information to workers at the plant and did not give numbers. It also confirmed reports that Russian troops had dug trenches in the most contaminated part of the Chernobyl exclusion zone receiving significant doses of radiation. There are unconfirmed reports that some are being treated in Belarus. Reuters news agency quoted workers at the plant as saying some of the soldiers had no idea they were in a radiation zone. The Russian military however said that after capturing the plant radiation levels at the plant itself had stayed within a normal range. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a statement that it was unable to confirm the reports. The head of Ukraines agency in charge of the exclusion zone Yevhen Kramarenko said that radiation levels appeared to be normal and there was no indication of significant damage. However as the sensors for detecting radiation levels were not working staff needed to check the facilities he added. The head of the IAEA said it was in close consultations with Ukrainian authorities on sending a mission to the Chernobyl plant very very soon. While Chernobyl is a word that evokes apocalypse nuclear experts stressed throughout this saga that there was no risk of another Chernobyl. There is no working nuclear reactor on the site. As Prof Claire Corkhill from Sheffield University told me at the time even if buildings containing contaminated material were pierced we wouldn\t be talking about plumes of radioactive smoke. She was much more concerned when Russian forces attacked a building at the working Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility on 4 March. That incident caused the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to plan a trip to Ukraine - essentially to ask Russian forces to keep nuclear facilities out of the line of fire. What is a concern in Chernobyl now Prof Corkhill told me is that we haven\t had regular communication between the site and the IAEA which basically keeps a safety log] of where any potentially hazardous material is. We now need to go in and establish that none of that material is missing. Other scientists are concerned about the damage that may have been caused to a place that has become a wildlife refuge and a site of international research collaboration. Prof Nick Beresford who studies the exclusion zone\s landscape says his Ukrainian colleagues now don\t know if they will have labs to return to. The zone itself over the last nearly 40 years has become a site for wildlife he added. Lots of rare species moved in when people moved out. We just don\t know how this will have affected the wildlife. In recent days Russia has said it will scale down its operations in northern Ukraine around the capital Kyiv and focus its forces on the eastern Donbas region. Chernobyl is located north of Kyiv. But on Thursday Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Moscow was repositioning rather than withdrawing in order to regroup resupply and reinforce its offensive in Donbas. At the same time Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities. So we can expect additional offensive actions bringing even more suffering he said. There was no change in Russias objective to pursue a military outcome he added. The occupation of the Chernobyl site since 24 February the day of the invasion has been dogged with concerns about power outages and problems for the staff many of whom were trapped there for weeks and could not get home. Although no longer a working power station Chernobyl was never fully abandoned and still requires constant management. How close was nuclear plant attack to catastrophe? Chernobyl workers ordeal under Russian guard It is the site of what is considered to be the worlds worst nuclear accident in 1986. The Russian withdrawal follows an announcement several days ago by the mayor of Slavutych a nearby town housing workers at the plant that Russian troops had left the town.

Ukraine war: Russian forces regrouping for attack - Nato,"The UK says Russia is bringing in between 1,200 and 2,000 troops from Georgia as reinforcements.",Ukraine war: Russian forces regrouping for attack - Nato Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption A man rides past a destroyed Russian tank in Trostyanets north-east Ukraine Russian forces in Ukraine are regrouping to double down on their attacks in the east of the country according to Natos secretary general. Russia is trying to regroup resupply and reinforce Jens Stoltenberg said. The UK said Russia was bringing in between 1200 and 2000 of its Russian troops from Georgia as reinforcements. Moscow said on Tuesday that it would reduce military activity in northern Ukraine and focus on liberating the Donbas region in the south-east. Mr Stoltenberg said Russias aim of pursuing a military outcome had not changed. We see continued shelling of cities and we see that Russia is re-positioning some of the troops moving some of them around most likely to reinforce their efforts in the Donbas region he said. At the same time Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities. So we can expect additional offensive actions bringing even more suffering. Russian shelling continuing as ground troops regroup Putin advisers too scared to tell him truth - US Ukraine sends buses to Mariupol for rescue efforts Echoing Mr Stoltenberg\s remarks the UK\s Defence Secretary Ben Wallace warned that Russia\s change in tactics was not a retreat. The UK also said bringing in Russian troops from breakaway areas of Georgia had not been part of Moscows original plan. It is highly unlikely that Russia planned to generate reinforcements in this manner and it is indicative of the unexpected losses it has sustained during the invasion the defence ministry tweeted. Around 20% of Russian troops around Kyiv have started to reposition according to a US senior defence official. The official added that the Russians had largely abandoned Hostomel airport outside of Kyiv and are also moving away from the Chernobyl nuclear plant. But they said Russia was keeping the pressure on in the air with air strikes continuing to fall on the cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv in the north. Bombs are also falling on towns and cities in the south which is becoming the key battlefront according to Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko cited by Reuters news agency. On Thursday evening Ukraines air force appealed for more support from Western countries saying it was operating outdated equipment that was no match for Russias more advanced systems had sustained losses and urgently needed modern fighter jets and air defence systems. The air force urged provision of F-15 or F-16 fighter jets which it said had the same advanced technology as the latest Russian fighter jets. Previous discussions had centred around Poland providing Russian-made Mig-29s but the plan was eventually dropped. It also called for the US Patriot or Norwegian Nasams missile systems. Truth: Air superiority is the deciding factor in this war. Air superiority has played a key role in all wars since WWII Ukraine\s air force tweeted. Russia concentrating efforts in Donbas Though US intelligence reports say Russian troops have not made much progress in the east since the invasion began Russia has said it will now concentrate its efforts on liberating the region. The region is home to the self-declared and Russian-backed peoples republics of Luhansk and Donetsk which are part of Ukraine but which Russia recognised as independent three days before invading. But Ukrainian troops have stymied and frustrated Russia\s progress in the region said the US defence intelligence official. They added it remains to be seen whether the refitting and repositioning of troops will make a difference. But that this could mean the conflict is lengthy and more drawn out.

Ukraine war: Gruesome evidence points to war crimes on road outside Kyiv,The BBC finds the charred remains of civilians on a highway where Russian troops had stationed tanks.,Ukraine war: Gruesome evidence points to war crimes on road outside Kyiv Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE JEREMY BOWEN Image caption Corpses and burned out cars litter this stretch of the E-40 highway Footage of Russian troops shooting a man with his hands up on a highway outside Kyiv at the beginning of March was shared around the world. Now the Russians have been pushed out of the area and the BBCs Jeremy Bowen has been to see the grim aftermath of their short-lived occupation. This report contains material some viewers will find disturbing We counted 13 bodies on a nightmarish stretch of road not much more than 200 yards long between Mria and Myla villages whose Ukrainian names translate as Dream and Sweetheart. Two of the dead are confirmed as Ukrainian civilians who were killed by the Russians. The others have not been identified yet - they lie where they were killed - but only two are wearing recognisable Ukrainian military uniforms. Our BBC team was able to get to the area on the main E-40 highway as it approaches Kyiv because Ukrainian forces had captured the sector only 10 hours earlier. The marks of battle and of heavy shelling were everywhere. Petrol stations and a hotel that was well-known for its spa and restaurant were in ruins. Shell holes and craters pockmarked both carriageways. Ukrainian troops changing a wheel in the ruins of a roadside garage said the Russians were about 4km (2.5 miles) away and had pulled their remaining men and armour back after a hard fight lasting several days in the early hours of the morning. Warning: Graphic video ahead Left behind in the heart of the desolation were the dead bodies and a mass of questions and concerns about who they were and how they died. Media caption Watch: Jeremy Bowen finds bodies on a road Russians occupied outside Kyiv Some answers already exist for a couple who were killed by the Russians and left to decompose on 7 March. Their rusty shrapnel riddled car lies in the road next to one of the petrol stations reduced to a shell by fire. Next to it are the burnt and twisted remains of a body that is just about recognisable as the remains of a man. A wedding ring is still on the corpses finger. Stretched out inside the hulk of their car is what is left of the incinerated body of a woman the mouth opened in what looks like a scream. Their deaths were filmed by a Ukrainian drone on 7 March operated by the Bugatti unit of Territorial Defence. The unit released the video which was republished by news organisations around the world. It caused outrage because it showed the cold-blooded killing of a man who had raised his arms to show he was harmless in the classic gesture of surrender. The bodies the BBC discovered in an investigation this month are of Maksim Iowenko and his wife Ksjena. They were part of a convoy of 10 civilian vehicles who were trying to escape the Russians and get to Kyiv. IMAGE SOURCE SUPPLIED Image caption Ksjena and Maksim Iowenko were civilians and should have been protected As they drove down the road they spotted a Russian tank in position dug into the grass verge. The drone video shows it was clearly marked with the letter V one of the identifiers used by the Russian armed forces. The other cars did quick U-turns and drove away at speed. But Maksims car stopped most likely because it was hit. As soon as the car stopped Maksim leapt out and raised his hands. Within seconds he was shot dead. His wife was killed in the car. Also in the car were their six-year-old son and the elderly mother of one of Maksims friends. Both of them survived and were eventually released by the Russian soldiers. They were found walking back down the road and the woman told her family that Maksim was shouting that a child was in the car when he was killed. Both survivors according to the Bugatti drone unit are now safe but deeply traumatised. Warning: Graphic images ahead The car is now burnt out but it was not on fire after the attack. One hypothesis must be that the bodies and the car were set on fire by the Russians to destroy the evidence of what they had done. The Bugatti Unit has submitted its drone video to the Ukrainian authorities and to the Metropolitan Police in London. More burnt cars and dead bodies line the road for the next few hundred yards. No video has emerged to show what happened. A credible working assumption for any investigation must be that the other dead people were killed by the tank crew or other Russian soldiers. IMAGE SOURCE JEREMY BOWEN Image caption Some of the evidence the BBC gathered is too disturbing to show in full. Here a dead man has been covered by rubber tyres IMAGE SOURCE JEREMY BOWEN Image caption Here a Ukrainian soldier gestures towards sets of charred human remains by a burned out vehicle Attempts have been made to destroy the other bodies. Some have been left to rot where they were killed. But other corpses have been piled up and surrounded by tyres. Charred clothing indicates attempts were made to set fires around them. Tyres are flammable and must have been placed there as an accelerant. The emplacement where the tank was dug in has a clear arc of fire across the area where the 13 bodies are lying. The tank has gone but debris was left by its crew including Russian army field rations. In the woods nearby is at least one other tank which has been burnt out after being hit by an anti-tank missile. A Ukrainian soldier produced a wallet he had found in the tank. He emptied out Russian identity papers bank notes in the Russian currency the rouble and small change in Belorussian coppers. The major thrust to the north-west of Kyiv came from invaders who had crossed the border from Belarus Moscows ally. Close by the knocked out tank are the remains of a chaotic camp with dugouts chairs and a long table piled high with the remains of food and drink. They are all surrounded by big piles of garbage rotten food and empty bottles of alcohol. Ukrainian soldiers said shops at the petrol stations were looted. Image caption An abandoned Russian camp: the soldiers are said to have looted petrol stations Next to the table is a large pair of bolt-cutters. Piles of unburied rubbish scattered in a forward position are usually a sign of undisciplined soldiers. We decided to drive two or three kilometres further down the road after Ukrainian soldiers said more Russian armour had been destroyed. In a small village a Russian tank and two armoured personnel carriers were broken and burnt. Some of the wreckage was still smoking. The force of the weapon that destroyed the tank blew off its turret and main gun which lay upside down and half buried in a crater around 15 yards away. In the pine woods on either side of the road Ukrainian soldiers were digging trenches and fox holes with shovels. Others were patrolling. It was far too early to say whether the Russians were gone for good or whether they would be back. What is clear though is that Russian forces under continued pressure from Ukrainian soldiers have been forced to yield strategic territory around Kyiv. Every time they move back the Ukrainian capital and its people become a little safer. Media caption Video captured by a Ukrainian aerial reconnaissance group appears to show Russian forces shooting at civilians As and when the Russians leave more evidence is likely to emerge of civilians having been killed - backing up the many stories that have emerged of such incidents. The gruesome scenes on the road were more than simply the terrible deaths of human beings who had become victims of President Putins decision to invade. It is also a crime scene with evidence that should be collected and preserved for an investigation whenever this war ends. Under the laws of war civilians are protected and when they are killed in defiance of those laws their deaths amount to war crimes.

Moscow said it would drastically reduce its military operations in two key areas of Ukraine to boost mutual trust in the talks which are being held in Istanbul. But while the decision to scale back operations around the capital Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv was the first sign of tangible progress many questions remain unanswered. Its unclear how extensive any reduction in military activity might be. The US has expressed scepticism too - noting how Russia has already refocused its military campaign on Ukraines east. Ukraine\s President Volodymyr Zelensky was more forthright saying positive signals from the talks did not drown out the explosions or Russian shells. The talks also featured an appearance from Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich - hours after reports emerged suggesting he had suffered suspected poisoning symptoms at peace talks earlier this month.

Image caption Stills from a video claiming to show mistreatment of Russian prisoners Ukrainian authorities are investigating video footage which has been said to show Ukrainian soldiers shooting Russian prisoners in the legs. The grainy video has been circulating on social media after first appearing in the early hours of Sunday. Since then its been widely reposted by pro-Russian accounts on various platforms. Ukrainian armed forces Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi said Russia was filming and distributing staged videos in order to discredit Ukraine\s treatment of Russian prisoners. However Oleksiy Arestovych an adviser to President Zelensky said there would be an immediate investigation and added: I would like to remind all our military civilians and defence forces that abusing prisoners of war is a war crime. The BBC has been analysing the video but has not yet been able to independently verify it. Heres what weve found out so far. Odesa defies Russia and embraces signs of life IMAGE SOURCE BBC NEWS In the south Ukrainian forces have had some success in pushing back Russian forces - raising doubts over whether Moscow will still try to seize control of the whole coastline.

But people there are unsure whether it is just a temporary lull in the fighting. The historic and cosmopolitan resort city is gently trying to reconnect with its famously relaxed holiday spirit as if embracing it were a form of defiance against the Kremlin. The recent reopening of clubs beach restaurants and nail salons across Odesa also reflects growing local confidence in the course of the war against Russia at least here on the Black Sea coast.

Pop superstars like Ed Sheeran Camila Cabello and Emeli Sande were among the artists at the Concert For Ukraine. Jamala gave an impassioned rendition of her Eurovision-winning track 1944. And the stories of two Ukrainians were put centre stage when they were read by actors Tamsin Greig and Eddie Marsan. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Ed Sheeran joined Camila Cabello on stage for their duet Bam Bam Scottish violinist Nicola Benedetti accompanied the actors as they delivered the harrowing accounts of fleeing the Russian invasion. Friday Night Dinner actress Greig read the words of Natalya who spent three days sheltering in a basement in Kharkiv before leaving on an overcrowded train later finding out her apartment block and university had been destroyed. Then Marsan voiced the words of Artem who spent four days travelling to Romania with his traumatised children. Benedettis haunting performance merged seamlessly with a viral video of Ukrainian violinist Illia Bondarenko playing a folk song while sheltering in a basement accompanied virtually by 94 other violinists from around the world. That segment provided a sobering perspective on a night when some of the biggest names in music delivered performances that ranged from the sombre to the uplifting. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Jamala held the Ukrainian flag during her performance Jamala received one of the loudest cheers of the night when she held up the Ukrainian flag that she had been holding throughout her performance. The singer herself fled Kyiv with her children at the start of the war. It was really hard but I am here she told ITV beforehand. Thank you so much to all musicians for supporting Ukraine for standing with Ukraine because it\s really important for us. Her song 1944 was inspired by her great-grandmother who was among thousands of Tatars who were forcibly deported from Crimea by Russian dictator Joseph Stalin during World War Two.

He then joined Cuban-American superstar Camila Cabello to perform their duet Bam Bam live for the first time. She said: We\re all praying tonight for the peace and the safety of the people in the Ukraine. Thank you guys so much for being a part of this super-important fundraiser. Singer-songwriter Tom Odell performed his ballad Another Love which has become adopted as an anthem of solidarity among Ukrainians on social media.

There was also a recorded message from US star Billie Eilish and brother and collaborator Finneas O\Connell who sent their support and solidarity. The event was broadcast live on ITV and STV. As well as millions of pounds of public donations the broadcasters donated an estimated £3m of advertising revenue. Another £250000 was generated by ticket sales. The funds will go to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC)s humanitarian appeal. The event was organised in three weeks by Guy Freeman from Livewire Pictures who told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that the artists and others from the music and TV industries had not hesitated to donate their time. Everybody was just so affected by those daily pictures of refugees displaced people leaving everything behind and us all feeling helpless he said. And so this is what I guess we in the live events and TV industry can do - something like this to try and help. Popular Ukrainian band Antytila whose members have become soldiers and volunteers during the war had posted a video showing them in military uniforms offering to perform in a live link-up from Kyiv. However organisers said they could not include them as we are only able to focus on the humanitarian situation not the politics or the military conflict. Antytila drummer Dmitriy Vodovozov told BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday: I don\t agree with it because we are living in war now and everything is political to us.]

"Ukraine war: Russia blocks buses heading to Mariupol, says Ukraine","Russia has blocked 45 buses heading to the city to rescue civilians, says Ukraine's deputy prime minister.",Ukraine war: Russia blocks buses heading to Mariupol says Ukraine Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Russian forces have been besieging Mariupol for weeks Fresh efforts are under way to evacuate civilians trapped by Russian forces in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said a convoy of 45 Ukrainian buses was on its way to the besieged southern city. She said the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had confirmed that Russia had agreed to open a humanitarian corridor to Mariupol. Tens of thousands of civilians remain there after weeks of bombardment. Ms Vereshchuk also accused Russian troops of blocking the bus convoy at a checkpoint near Vasylivka three hours drive from Mariupol earlier in the day. The Russian Federation again does not let our buses pass she told Ukrainian news agency Unian. The Russian defence ministry said the United Nations refugee agency and the Red Cross would assist in the evacuation of civilians. The evacuation was initially planned for Thursday but the Red Cross has since told Reuters that for logistical and security reasons the evacuation will now happen on Friday. It said a ceasefire would allow people to travel westwards to Zaporizhzhia via the Russian-controlled port of Berdyansk. A spokesperson for the ICRC said its teams were ready to help get civilians out of Mariupol from Friday but only if all parties agreed on the terms. It\s desperately important that this operation takes place. The lives of tens of thousands of people in Mariupol depend on it the spokesperson added. The BBC has spoken to people who have managed to leave the besieged port city in the last few weeks. All of them described a city in ruins with entire districts completely flattened. Diana Yalovets a 23-year-old student said: As we tried to get out we needed to cross the city centre. It was scary to see destroyed streets and buildings. My school was destroyed. It\s painful to see your once beautiful city this way. Mariupol was a safe city. We loved to walk near the sea. There was a park and it was an amazing place just to sit and talk. I just can\t believe we lost everything we had. Although some residents have escaped all previous attempts to establish a ceasefire in Mariupol have collapsed amid accusations of bad faith from both sides. Russia has also been accused of forcibly relocating thousands of civilians to Russia or Russian-controlled areas. Capturing the city would give Russia control of the Azov Sea coastline between Russia and Crimea. The announcement of a truce follows a telephone call on Tuesday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. During the conversation Mr Putin said that shelling of Mariupol would not end until Ukrainian troops surrendered.

Ukraine war: Russia threatens to stop supplying gas if not paid in roubles,"Vladimir Putin orders ""unfriendly"" foreign buyers of Russia's gas to open Russian bank accounts.",Ukraine war: Russia threatens to stop supplying gas if not paid in roubles By Michael Race Business reporter BBC News Published 2 days ago comments Comments Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Russia has told unfriendly foreign countries they must start paying for gas in roubles or it will cut supplies. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree stating buyers must open rouble accounts in Russian banks from Friday. Nobody sells us anything for free and we are not going to do charity either - that is existing contracts will be stopped the Russian president said. Mr Putins demand is being seen as an attempt to boost the rouble which has been hit by Western sanctions. His decree means foreign buyers of Russian gas would have to open an account at Russias Gazprombank and transfer euros or US dollars into it. Gazprombank would then convert this into roubles which will then be used to make the payment for gas. Though the order comes into effect for gas exported from Friday onwards the payments for that gas will not be paid by European buyers until mid-May Dr Jack Sharples a research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies told the BBC. That suggests there may not be an immediate threat to supplies. Mr Putin said the switch to roubles was meant to strengthen Russias sovereignty and it would stick to its obligations on all contracts if Western nations obliged. Germany said the change announced by Mr Putin amounted to blackmail. Since Russia invaded Ukraine Western nations have issued economic and trading sanctions on Russia but the European Union has not placed bans on oil or gas unlike the US and Canada as its member nations rely heavily on it. The EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia and has no easy substitutes if supplies are disrupted. Meanwhile Russia currently gets €400m (£340m) per day from gas sales to the bloc and it has no way of rerouting this supply to other markets. For the Kremlin this is designed to suggest a dramatic escalation in the economic battle between the West and Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has outlined a pathway for the cutting of gas supplies to Europe if Western customers refuse to pay for supplies in the Russian currency the rouble. However the market reaction suggests the details of the mechanism mean that in practice European customers will just have to change their currency dealers to Gazprombank. That bank has already been left unsanctioned by the EU for the purpose of continuity of energy trade. As a result gas prices remain very high but did not today shoot into the stratosphere. There should be a workaround. As one leading analyst told me this solution has saved face for Putin who can sound tough on domestic TV. Ultimately as Russian officials have repeatedly said for decades Russian supply of energy to the West continued uninterrupted even during the height of the Cold War. Ultimately Russia still needs the money for the gas and still wants to leave the possibility of a market for its main export once a peace deal is signed. However it is also true to say that the threat of a cut-off has escalated. EU nations have prepared emergency measures to manage demand and would be more willing to face that now during spring and summer than winter. The net effect of the mechanism announced is to limit the ability of the West to freeze the revenues they pay to Gazprom which Putin described as receiving the gas for free. Some Ukrainian officials have suggested such an approach. Oil and gas dollars and euros continue to help the Kremlin resist an otherwise tough set of financial sanctions. Major potential escalation Analysts said Russia halting gas flows to EU member countries to force the issue would mark a major escalation not even performed at the height of the Cold War. It would mark another major financial blow to Russia\s coffers the analysts at Fitch Solutions added. It is also unclear whether Russias new payment mechanism for gas would fully ban payments in euros. Western companies and governments have rejected Russias demands to pay for gas in roubles as a breach of existing contracts which are set in euros or US dollars. Germany and Austria take step towards gas rationing Russia to allow unauthorised imports from West German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said German companies would continue to pay for Russian gas using euros as stipulated in contracts. Nathan Piper head of oil and gas research at Investec told the BBC the move by Mr Putin was an attempt to put economic pressure back on Europe and that more foreign exchange demand for roubles would likely push up the value of the currency. However long term Russia needs to remain a reliable supplier of gas so it is unclear if they would actually restrict gas supply he added. That said even the risk of it is keeping UK/European gas prices at near record highs and six times the 10-year average. This is translating to steep rises in consumers\ energy bills. IMAGE SOURCE AFP Image caption The Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline was inaugurated just over a decade ago between Russia and Germany Dr Sharples of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said the two sides could adapt and continue their trade uninterrupted or one or both parties could claim breach of contract and escalate the situation. One would hope that even if the situation escalated to a point where one or both parties call for arbitration that the gas would continue to flow. However a stoppage cannot be ruled out he said. Germany and Austria trigger emergency plans Germany which gets about half its gas and a third of its oil from Russia has urged its citizens and companies to reduce consumption in anticipation of possible shortages. Austria which imports about 40% of its gas from Russia is tightening its monitoring of the market. Under an existing gas emergency plan the early warning phase which both Germany and Austria have begun is the first of three steps designed to prepare the country for a potential supply shortage. In its final stage the governments would bring in gas rationing. Elsewhere Bulgaria which gets 90% of its gas via imports from Russian company Gazprom has opened a tender for underground drilling as part of plans to almost double the countrys gas storage capacity and prepare for any supply disruptions. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases. The UK government said it was not planning to pay for Russian gas in roubles.]

"Ukraine war: Putin being misled by fearful advisers, US says","News on Russia's poor military performance is not making it back to Putin, the White House says.",Ukraine war: Putin being misled by fearful advisers US says Published 3 days ago comments Comments Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption The US and UK say Putin is being misinformed by his advisers Russian President Vladimir Putin is being misled by advisers who are too scared to tell him how badly the war in Ukraine is going the White House says. Meanwhile British intelligence says Russian troops in Ukraine are demoralised short of equipment and refusing to carry out orders. Mr Putin is also not being told about the full impact of sanctions on the Russian economy the White House said. The Kremlin said the US had a total misunderstanding of the situation. Mr Putin\s chief spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists: They simply don\t understand what\s happening in the Kremlin they don\t understand President Putin they don\t understand how decisions are taken and they don\t understand the style of our work. This was worrying he added because such total misunderstanding leads to wrong decisions which have bad consequences. Earlier White House spokesperson Kate Bedingfield said the US had information that Mr Putin felt misled by the Russian military and this had resulted in persistent tension between Putin and his military leadership. Putin\s war has been a strategic blunder that has left Russia weaker over the long term and increasingly isolated on the world stage she said. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby called the assessments discomforting because an uninformed Putin could result in a less than faithful effort at ending the conflict through peace negotiations. The other thing is you don\t know how a leader like that is going to react to getting bad news he said. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption People are continuing to be evacuated from Irpin where Ukraine says it has pushed Russia back Ukrainian forces have begun attempts to retake some areas from Russia which on Tuesday said it would scale back operations around Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv. Jeremy Fleming the head of the UK\s cyber-intelligence agency GCHQ said the move added to indications Russia had massively misjudged the situation and had been forced to significantly rethink. We\ve seen Russian soldiers - short of weapons and morale - refusing to carry out orders sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft Mr Fleming said in a speech to the Australian National University in Canberra. And even though Putin\s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth what\s going on and the extent of these misjudgements must be crystal clear to the regime. On the ground US and Ukrainian officials say Russia is continuing to reposition forces away from Kyiv probably as part of its effort to refocus on eastern regions. In other developments: President Volodymyr Zelensky cast doubt on Russia\s claims it was de-escalating calling it the precursor to new strikes in the eastern Donbas region. We don\t believe anyone. Not a single beautiful word he said Russias defence ministry proposed a one-day ceasefire in besieged Mariupol on Thursday to let people leave. This came after Mr Putin said Mariupol would have to surrender to stop the shelling A US defence official said some Russian troops were leaving the Chernobyl area - home to a former nuclear plant that was the site of the world\s worst nuclear accident in 1986 - and heading to neighbouring Belarus. We think that they are leaving I can\t tell you that they\re all gone the official said Four million Ukrainians have fled the country and a quarter of the population has been displaced French military intelligence chief Gen Éric Vidaud has been dismissed from his post for not predicting the Russian invasion French media report Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine are due to restart online on 1 April according to Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia. In an online post cited by Reuters Mr Arakhamia said Ukraine had proposed the leaders of both countries meet but Russia declined saying more work was needed on a draft treaty. Mr Zelensky meanwhile characterised the talks as only words no specifics yet following a similarly downbeat assessment from Russia.

Ukraine war: How reliant is the world on Russia for oil and gas?,Russia has threatened to cut off gas supplies if countries ban its oil.,Ukraine war: How reliant is the world on Russia for oil and gas? By Jake Horton Daniele Palumbo & Tim Bowler BBC Reality Check Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Fuel prices have soared since Russias invasion of Ukraine President Vladimir Putin has threatened to cut gas supplies to unfriendly countries if they don\t start paying for gas imports in Russian roubles. The US EU and UK placed restrictions on oil and gas imports from Russia after it invaded Ukraine in February. What sanctions are there on Russian oil and gas? The US has declared a complete ban on Russian oil gas and coal imports. The UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year and the EU is reducing its Russian gas imports by two-thirds. The UK government says this allows enough time for it to find alternative supplies. Deputy Russian Prime Minister Alexander Novak has said rejecting Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market. Oil and gas prices have risen since the invasion of Ukraine and if Russia were to halt exports they could rise further. What would happen if Russian gas stopped flowing into Europe? Heating prices - which are already high - would increase even more. Russian gas accounts for about 40% of the EUs natural gas imports. If this dried up Italy and Germany would be especially vulnerable. Europe could turn to existing gas exporters such Qatar Algeria or Nigeria but there are practical obstacles to quickly expanding production. Russia only provides about 5% of the UKs gas supplies and the US doesnt import any Russian gas. Gas prices in Europe the UK (and to a lesser extent the US) jumped significantly after the invasion due to worries about supply shortages although they then fell back. Could alternatives to Russian gas be found? The US has agreed to ship an additional 15 billion cubic metres of liquified natural gas (LNG) to Europe by the end of this year. The aim is to supply 50 billion cubic metres per year of additional gas until at least 2030. But energy policy research analyst Ben McWilliams says its not very easy to substitute the gas that flows from Russia. It\s harder to substitute gas because we have these big pipes that are taking Russian gas to Europe says Mr McWilliams. Europe could also ramp up the use of other energy sources but doing so is not quick or easy. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption The EU hopes to massively boost its use of renewable energy including wind power Renewables take time to roll out so in the short term this is not a solution says research analyst Simone Tagliapietra. So for next winter - what can make a difference is fuel switching such as opening up coal-fired power plants as Italy and Germany have plans to do in case of an emergency. The EU has proposed a plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels before 2030 - including measures to diversify gas supplies and replace gas in heating and power generation. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline and the Ukraine crisis IEA: Green energy needed to avoid turbulent prices How much oil does Russia export? Russia is the third biggest producer of oil in the world behind the US and Saudi Arabia. Of about five million barrels of crude oil it exports each day more than half of that goes to Europe. Russian imports account for 8% of total UK oil demand. The US is less reliant with about 3% of its imported oil coming from Russia in 2020. What about alternative oil supplies? Mr McWilliams says it should be easier to find alternative suppliers for oil than for gas because while some comes from Russia there\s also a lot of shipments from elsewhere. US President Joe Biden has ordered a major release of oil from Americas strategic reserves in an effort to bring down high fuel costs. The US has been asking Saudi Arabia to increase its oil production but it has rebuffed previous US requests to boost output in order to reduce oil prices. Saudi Arabia is the biggest producer in Opec the oil cartel which accounts for about 60% of the crude oil traded internationally. Because of this Opec has a key role in influencing oil prices. So far no Opec member has agreed to any requests to boost output. Russia is not in Opec but has been working with it since 2017 to place limits on oil production in order to maintain earnings for producers. The US is also looking at relaxing Venezuelas oil sanctions. It used to be a key US oil supplier but recently Venezuela has largely been selling its oil to China. What will happen to my heating and fuel bills? Consumers will face rising energy and fuel bills as a result of this war. In the UK household energy bills have been kept in check by an energy price cap. But bills will rise by £700 to about £2000 in April when the cap is increased. They are expected to reach about £3000 when the cap is increased again this autumn. UK petrol and diesel prices have also soared and the government has now announced a cut in fuel duty as motorists struggle with record prices. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Heating bills are set to rise sharply this year in the UK I think if we\re in a world where Russian oil and gas stop flowing to Europe then we\re going to need rationing-style measures says Mr McWilliams. Part of the conversation now is can we tell households to turn their thermostats down one degree which can save a significant chunk of gas.

First 200 Homes for Ukraine scheme refugees to arrive in Lincolnshire,About 200 people fleeing the Russian invasion are due to arrive in Lincolnshire in the next month.,First 200 Homes for Ukraine scheme refugees to arrive in Lincolnshire Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption People fleeing the war in Ukraine will be hosted by Lincolnshire families About 200 Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion of their homeland are set to arrive in Lincolnshire. The first phase of the Homes for Ukraine scheme will see about 30 evacuees arriving in each of the countys seven districts over the next few weeks. It is part of the governments plan to house people escaping the war-torn country with host families in the UK. Charities say the application process is too difficult for those fleeing The latest government figures show that there have been 2700 visas issued for refugees coming to the UK as part of Homes for Ukraine - fewer than 10% of the 28300 applications made in the first 15 days. Under the scheme hosts and guests are required to find each other and make a match before either side can then make the necessary visa application. Lord Harrington refugees minister has admitted the forms took too long to fill in and said the government was trying to speed up the process. Hearts and homes According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service potential hosts will now have their homes checked by local councils to ensure they are suitable. Richard Wright Conservative leader of North Kesteven District Council and county representative on the regional migration board thanked people who has who had offered up their hearts and homes. Lincolnshire is clearly standing ready to welcome as many evacuating Ukrainians as we are able to and to offer the levels of support necessary to assist them and their sponsoring hosts in settling into their new circumstances at a pace that respects their need for time and space he said. Hosts are being supported by the Lincolnshire Resettlement Partnership which expects more arrivals over the coming months. Earlier this month Sir Edward Leigh Conservative MP for Gainsborough was criticised over comments he made during a debate on Ukraine when he said the county had done our bit on immigration from Eastern Europe adding that migration had already led to extreme pressure in terms of housing and jobs. He later claimed his comments were misinterpreted or taken out of context. Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook Twitter and Instagram.

Ukraine war: Mariupol's refugees carry wounds of battered city,Residents who have escaped the besieged city are trying to leave behind memories of its destruction.,Ukraine war: Mariupols refugees carry wounds of battered city By Lucy Williamson BBC News Lviv Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption Mariupol residents Yevgen and Natalia have made it to Lviv in western Ukraine There is no humanitarian corridor now out of Mariupol. Just a trickle of people gambling on Russian military checkpoints - and Russian political whim. But getting out of the besieged southern city is only the first challenge; the other is leaving it behind when you do. Alexander was brought to an Israeli field hospital near Lviv last week catatonic. His 24-year-old brain was stuck on the horror hed lived through: on the Russian rockets that hit the apartment block where he was staying with his parents; on the rubble and dead bodies they ran through without even putting on their shoes. It was constant bombing says his father Yevgen. Planes went past every 10 minutes and dropped bombs on Mariupol. People were falling and dying in front of my eyes. We buried people in gardens. The family found shelter with hundreds of others in a cinema near the city centre. Trapped there by Russian attacks they survived on scraps of food from locals or Ukrainian soldiers boiling snow to drink. Image caption The family are staying with friends outside Lviv after fleeing Mariupol When supplies ran critically low Natalia says everyone without young children was asked to leave - to save resources and give the children a chance. We had a car that was damaged but still working she said so we decided to leave the shelter. There was no way out: you could stay and die or you could go and die. You couldn\t even count minutes between the bombs. Memories like these mask their old lives like a second skin. The destruction and damage to Mariupol is carried out of the city with them; invisible shrapnel lodged in their minds. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Some 160000 people are still thought to be trapped in Mariupol Mariupols mayor says 5000 people have been killed and 90% of the buildings damaged. Some of their pro-Russian neighbours Natalia says believed it was Ukrainian forces pounding their city to dust. She refers to the Russian soldiers sarcastically as our saviours or those charming boys describing the pressure tactics she saw them use. After the shelling those \handsome boys\ would appear and try to hand out sweets she said. Some people couldn\t resist taking them because they hadn\t eaten for several days. When you\re suffering like that you\ll take anything. Image caption Natalia says they were told to flee when resources ran low Some 160000 people are thought to still be trapped inside the city. France Greece and Turkey have all tried to push for a pause in the attacks to get aid in and allow civilians to leave. But Russias President Putin has said Mariupol must surrender in order for the bombardment to stop. Alexander and his family are now staying with friends outside Lviv. And Alexander has just been discharged and allowed to go home. His father Yevgen is a musician with one remaining saxophone he salvaged from the city before he left. Before taking his son home from hospital he gave staff at the hospital a concert Alexander smiling on beside him. Gathered between the medical tents to listen half the doctors were in tears. They listened to the beautiful sound from the man who had lost so much but who stood there giving thanks for what he saved from Mariupol: his saxophone and his son.

Ukraine War: Putin demands Mariupol surrender to end shelling,Russia's defence ministry has since proposed a one-day ceasefire on Thursday to let civilians leave.,Ukraine War: Putin demands Mariupol surrender to end shelling Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that shelling of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol will only end when Ukrainian troops surrender. Mr Putin made the comments during an hour long phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday night the Kremlin said in a statement. But French officials said the Russian leader had agreed to consider plans to evacuate civilians from the city. Russia later proposed a one-day ceasefire for Thursday. The defence ministry said the ceasefire would start at 10:00 local time (08:00 BST) and would allow people to travel westwards to Zaporizhzhia via the Russian-controlled port of Berdyansk. On Thursday morning Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said a convoy of Ukrainian buses was on its way to Mariupol to try to evacuate civilians. She said the International Committee of the Red Cross had confirmed that Russia had agreed to open a humanitarian corridor to the city. Previous attempts to establish a ceasefire in Mariupol have collapsed amid accusations of bad faith from both sides. Russia has also been accused of forcibly relocating thousands of civilians to Russia or Russian-controlled areas. The announcement comes as new satellite photos showed the destruction caused by the shelling. The images released by the Earth observation company Maxar showed that residential areas have been reduced to rubble and highlighted Russian artillery cannons in firing positions on the outskirts of the city. IMAGE SOURCE MAXAR Officials from France\s Elyseé palace called the situation in the city catastrophic and added that civilian populations must be protected and must leave the city if they wish to. They must have access to food aid water and the medicines they need. This very degraded humanitarian situation is linked to the siege of the city by the Russian armed forces the statement said. France along with Turkey Greece and several humanitarian groups have presented Mr Putin with a plan to evacuate the city. Officials said that Mr Putin told Mr Macron that he will think about the proposal. But in its readout of the call the Kremlin appeared to suggest that Mr Putin has provided no such assurances. Russian officials said Mr Putin told the French leader that in order to resolve the difficult humanitarian situation in this city Ukrainian nationalist militants must stop resisting and lay down their arms. The statement added that Mr Putin had given Mr Macron detailed information about measures taken by the Russian military to provide emergency humanitarian assistance and ensure the safe evacuation of civilians from the besieged south-eastern city. Ukraine has accused Russia of forcibly relocating thousands of people from Mariupol to Russian-held territory. IMAGE SOURCE MAXAR Image caption Russian artillery positions on the periphery of Mariupol The call followed claims by the mayor of Mariupol that thousands of people have been killed during the Russian bombardment of the port city. Vadym Boychenko who has been evacuated from the city told the Reuters news agency that almost 5000 people including around 210 children have been killed since Russian shelling began. Matilda Bogner the head of the UN human rights mission in Ukraine told Reuters that she believes there could be thousands of deaths civilian casualties in Mariupol. The International Red Cross humanitarian organisation has confirmed reports that one of its warehouses in the city has been hit by Russian shelling telling the BBC that all supplies in the depot had already been distributed. It added that it no longer has a team on the ground and therefore could not comment on potential extent of casualties or damage. Are you or your family in Mariupol?

War in Ukraine: Russia launches new attacks after peace promise,"The Chernihiv governor says Russia bombarded the city overnight, despite pledge to reduce attacks.",War in Ukraine: Russia launches new attacks after peace promise Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EPA There has been no let-up in attacks on Ukraines northern cities despite Russias pledge to reduce military action regional authorities say. Russia said on Tuesday it would cut back operations around Chernihiv and the capital Kyiv in an effort to boost mutual trust in peace talks. But the Chernihiv regions governor told the BBC attacks had continued overnight into Wednesday. Ukraine also said there had been no mass removal of troops. Oleksandr Motuzyanyk a spokesperson for Ukraines armed forces said that though there had been a partial movement of troops from the directions of Kyiv and Chernihiv they had yet to fully abandon attempts to seize or at least surround these cities. Later on Wednesday a US defence official said some Russian troops were leaving the Chernobyl area - home to a former nuclear plant that was the site of the worlds worst nuclear accident in 1986. Chernobyl is an] area where they are beginning to reposition some of their troops - leaving walking away from the Chernobyl facility and moving into Belarus the official said. We think that they are leaving I can\t tell you that they\re all gone the official added. The decommissioned nuclear power station has been under Russian control since late-February a move that has been subject to widespread international condemnation. There have also been concerns over the welfare of workers at the Chernobyl site. Russia says it will curb Kyiv assault as peace talks progress Putin demands Mariupol surrender to end shelling The UN\s Human Rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet meanwhile said Russia\s allegedly indiscriminate attacks on populated areas of Ukraine may amount to war crimes. Addressing the Human Rights Council in Geneva Switzerland on Tuesday she said there were credible allegations that Russia had used cluster munitions in populated areas on multiple occasions. Such weapons are widely banned by an international treaty but neither Russia nor Ukraine are signed up to it. Her office has also verified 77 incidents in which medical facilities had been damaged - including 50 hospitals. Russian attacks continue To date 350 civilians have been killed in the city with 25 to 40 casualties arriving at the hospitals every day Chernihivs mayor told the BBCs Ukrainian Service. Vladyslav Atroshenko said he never thought that as mayor he would ever have to look for extra fridges to store the bodies of the dead because the morgues are full. He never thought he would have to look for additional teams of carpenters to make coffins and for alternative places to bury the dead because the cemetery is too dangerous to travel to. Local officials said Russian shelling continued to hit civilian infrastructure in the city. The entire night was pretty tense regional governor Viacheslav Chaus told the BBC. They attacked Nizhyn and Chernihiv. Mostly Chernihiv. Again part of the civilian infrastructure was destroyed. Chernihiv still has no electricity water supply and heat. It won\t be easy to restore this infrastructure. None of the military buildings were targeted last night. They kept attacking only civilian infrastructure the governor said. The BBC has not been able to confirm this independently but residents of Chernihiv also said the fighting was continuing. This night was rough one resident told the BBC. We heard there was fighting all night in the suburbs away from the city centre. We heard artillery. But there was no aviation tonight. Another resident said shelling was continuing on Wednesday although not as intensely as overnight. Air raid sirens also sounded in Kyiv just a few hours after the announcement that troops would be reduced around the city. Kyivs deputy mayor Mykola Povoroznyk said the capital itself had not been shelled overnight however gunfire had been heard from battles around the city. US and Ukrainian officials say Russia is continuing to reposition forces away from Kyiv probably as part of an effort to refocus on eastern regions. Ukrainian forces have also made advances in recent days retaking areas from Russian forces. In Irpin near Kyiv the mayor said Ukrainian forces had retaken control of the town on Monday and around 200 to 300 civilians had died in the town before it was retaken. Developments on the ground come as Russian and Ukrainian negotiators made no breakthroughs in Tuesday\s peace talks the Kremlin said.

A key aim of Russias invasion was to stop Ukraine joining the Nato alliance and Russian officials said the talks had moved to a practical stage. Russia\s pledge to cut back military activity was met with scepticism. Ukrainians are not naïve people President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an overnight video address. Mr Zelensky said that initial signs from the peace talks were positive but added that they did not drown out the explosions of Russian shells. Other countries also reacted with caution. US President Joe Biden said: I don\t read anything into it until I see what their actions are. Leaders from UK France Germany and Italy also urged the West not to drop its guard against Russia. In other developments: Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that shelling of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol will only end when Ukrainian troops surrender Germany has declared an early warning over possible gas supply disruption amid a payments stand-off with Russia More than four million people have now fled Ukraine to escape Russias invasion according to the latest United Nations figures.

Media in Russia: How do Russians get news about the war in Ukraine?,"As censorship of the Russian media increases, what information do Russians have access to?",Media in Russia: How do Russians get news about the war in Ukraine? By Vitaliy Shevchenko BBC Monitoring Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS The situation in Russias media is unprecedented. Restrictions on reporting are increasingly severe and access to almost all independent outlets is blocked or limited - or they censor themselves. Despite this it is still possible to obtain uncensored information in Russia. For most Russians television remains the main source of the news. It is firmly controlled by the Kremlin and pumps out relentless war propaganda. Ukrainians are said to shell their own cities and Russian troops are presented as liberators. The fact that the majority of Russians tune in to TV news means they are inclined to at least hear the Kremlins message - and possibly believe it. There is more variety of opinion in the press but it still largely sticks to the Kremlin line. A stalwart of independent reporting for almost 29 years the Novaya Gazeta newspaper suspended operations on 28 March after receiving warnings from Russias media watchdog Roskomnadzor. IMAGE SOURCE NOVAYA GAZETA Image caption The day after the war began Novaya Gazetas front page exclaimed Russia. Bombs. Ukraine Online most independent news websites are blocked or restricted and so are Facebook Instagram and Twitter. But crucially these blocks are relatively easy to bypass. By now anyone in Russia who is reasonably savvy with computers and smartphones will be familiar with tools such as virtual private networks (VPNs) which help to circumvent the restrictions. They are not yet outlawed in Russia and they are what millions of Russians are using to access uncensored information. War in Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine SURVIVAL: They wont tell me how many bullets were in me SHOOTING: Does video show Ukrainian war crime? READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Reporting on the war is another matter. In early March Russia passed a law under which publishing false information about what the Russian army is doing is punishable by up to 15 years in jail. In practice this means punishment for reporting anything that challenges the Kremlin\s narratives on its campaign in Ukraine. The media are even banned from calling it a war: it is meant to be called a special military operation. As a result some of the few remaining independent media in Russia have started to censor themselves. For example Novaya Gazeta blurred out the anti-war poster held up by a protester who interrupted a live news bulletin on Russian state TV. В эфире программы «Время» за спиной ведущей Екатерины Андреевой появилась девушка с плакатом содержание которого нам запрещают передать Роскомнадзор и Уголовный кодекс.  По неподтвержденной информации это редактор Марина Овсянникова.

Among the most prominent outlets are the Meduza and Mediazona websites - both have been blocked in Russia and both are labelled as foreign agents by the Russian government.

"Homes for Ukraine: 2,700 visas issued, government reveals","Application forms take too long to fill in, the government admits, and vows to speed up the process.",Homes for Ukraine: 2700 visas issued government reveals By Lauren Turner BBC News Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE ANADOLU AGENCY There have been 2700 visas issued for refugees coming to the UK as part of Homes for Ukraine - less than 10% of the 28300 applications made in the schemes first 15 days. Lord Harrington refugees minister admitted the forms took too long to fill in and said the government was trying to speed up the process. There has been criticism of the scheme since it was launched. Charities said the process is just too difficult for those fleeing Ukraine. The quickest way to help people would be for the UK to stop requiring visas for those fleeing Ukraine - and would bring it in line with many other countries which have done so since the crisis began said the British Red Cross. The charity said it has had representatives at major airports and arrival hubs since 19 March - but so far only 65 people arriving from Ukraine had been helped. Sonya Sceats chief executive of the Freedom from Torture charity said: In a month where people across the country signed up to welcome more refugees than the government has in 10 years these woeful numbers prove why visa-based schemes are an unsuitable gateway for refugees fleeing Ukraine to reach safety here in the UK. Homeless refugees in UK On top of the 2700 Homes for Ukraine visas a further 22800 visas from 31200 applications have been issued under the Ukraine Family Scheme the Home Office said. These are for those with close relatives living in the UK. But even those with visas are not always being housed. Some refugees have been reporting themselves to councils as being homeless the Local Government Association said. Its chair James Jamieson said it was a big issue. So far 57 councils have said people had presented as homeless - 44 who were part of the family scheme and 56 from Homes from Ukraine. Another 64 had entered through other routes possibly travelling to Ireland and then entering the UK from there he added. How can I offer a UK home to Ukrainian refugees? Sad slow and frustrating Homes for Ukraine launched on 14 March. Its aim is to allow individuals charities community groups and other organisations to sponsor named refugees housing them in their homes or buildings. Those who do not personally know someone fleeing Ukraine have been advised to contact groups who are starting to make connections between individuals to match them to a refugee. The UK requires the refugees to have a visa before they enter unlike other European countries which have waived the checks to speed things up. Those who are granted a visa under the scheme will be eligible to work and can access state benefits and public services for three years. Refugees with a valid Ukrainian international passport can apply online but those without one have to go to a visa application centre - Lord Harrington said approximately 10% of applications so far are having to go to the centres. Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended the government\s overwhelmingly generous record on refugees saying 1000 visas were being processed a day and telling MPs: There is no upper limit to the number that we can take. It came after Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said paperwork is being put ahead of people with one elderly couple on the Polish border with Ukraine being told it was just too complicated to come to the UK. War in Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine SURVIVAL: They wont tell me how many bullets were in me SHOOTING: Does video show Ukrainian war crime? READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Lord Harrington said he had tried to fill the application form in himself and it had taken nearly an hour - he said while this was from the comfort of his own home on a tablet people were completing it on mobile phones while they were displaced. He told the Levelling Up Housing and Communities Committee progress was already being seen due to Home Office efforts to streamline the visa process and the government was looking at every single step of the process to speed it up. But he added: We need to do more and will be making further improvements to bring people to the UK as quickly as possible. Lord Harrington said in some parts of the form there were four or five separate questions on as many pages suggesting this could be condensed to one page. He added: The response of the British public has been incredible opening their hearts and homes to the people of Ukraine and we must do everything we can to make the most of this extraordinary generosity. The minister said the run rate for applications for both schemes together was anticipated to soon be 15000 a week - within the next three weeks - and that he anticipated the backlog would be cleared quite quickly. IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption Refugees can also enter the UK if they have close relatives in the country like this family of 10 who are now living near Cambridge Labour is calling for the process to be expedited with Yvette Cooper shadow home secretary and shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy writing to their government counterparts. They said a shameful scale of bureaucracy was preventing desperately vulnerable people from reaching sanctuary in the UK calling for clarity on the length of time taken for visas to be issued and how long security checks are taking. The UN refugee agency said more than four million refugees have now fled Ukraine since Russia launched its war in the biggest refugee crisis since World War Two.

Ukraine family in Alton 'supported with kindness',Pharmacist Biola Ameri and her children fled Kyiv and currently reside in Alton.,Ukraine family in Alton supported with kindness Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption Biola Ameri and her daughters have found a temporary home in Hampshire A woman who came to the UK with her two daughters to escape the conflict in Ukraine has spoken of the kindness they have received since arriving. Pharmacist Biola Ameri 42 Gabriella eight and Daniella six fled Kyiv and currently reside in Alton Hampshire. Her husband Igor is currently in Vinnytsia helping women and children in Ukraine reach the border with Moldova. Ms Ameri said: I didn\t want to leave Ukraine. I love Ukraine. She came to the UK not via the Homes for Ukraine scheme but on a tourist visa that she had previously applied for to visit Scotland but hopes to get permission to stay when it runs out. They are being hosted by the family of Lisa Hillan and the children are said to have received a warm welcome at a local school. IMAGE SOURCE EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCY Image caption The family fled Kyiv when the war broke out Ms Ameri said: I was really overwhelmed with my emotions when I first came to England and when I first met people who don\t know us but who can support us with all this kindness for our family. She said she cried at border control and that someone there was very worried about us and brought an apple and juice for the children. I saw that everybody wants to help us and I really feel not as a guest but as a part of a family. Ms Hallan who is a member of Alton Town Council\s resilience fund panel said what the family had endured was heartrending. It\s difficult to fathom that this is not a historical documentary that this is happening to people like us in another county. It\s mindboggling and horrific she said. There is a desperate need to do something practical to help in some small way. My husband and I feel like we can\t just sit here and do nothing. Ukraine-Alton Mutual Aid was set up in Alton to enable residents to offer rooms transport clothes and English lessons. But Ms Ameri said: My daughter... made a wish for the tooth-fairy. She said \I don\t want any presents or money - I just want the tooth-fairy to bring our daddy here.\]

What is a war crime and could Putin be prosecuted over Ukraine?,If Russia has carried out war crimes in Ukraine how could Putin or his army generals be prosecuted?,What is a war crime and could Putin be prosecuted over Ukraine? By Dominic Casciani Legal correspondent BBC News Published 6 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS A former judge at the International Criminal Court has been asked by the UK to help Ukraine investigate potential war crimes by Russia. Sir Howard Morrisons appointment comes as Russia stands accused of violating international law in its invasion of Ukraine. What is a war crime? It may not seem like it but even war has rules as the International Committee of the Red Cross puts it. These are contained in treaties called the Geneva Conventions and a string of other international laws and agreements. Civilians cannot be deliberately attacked - nor can the infrastructure that is vital to their survival. UK war crimes lawyer appointed to help Ukraine Some weapons are banned because of the indiscriminate or appalling suffering they cause - such as anti-personnel landmines and chemical or biological weapons. The sick and wounded must be cared for - including injured soldiers who have rights as prisoners of war. Other laws prohibit torture and genocide - the deliberate attempt to destroy a specific group of people. Serious offences during war such as murder rape or mass persecution of a group are known as crimes against humanity. What allegations of war crimes have there been in Ukraine? Last week US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia had destroyed apartment buildings schools hospitals critical infrastructure civilian vehicles shopping centres and ambulances - actions that the US said amounted to war crimes. The UK has said barbaric and indiscriminate tactics have been used by Russia. In the wake of an attack on a theatre sheltering civilians in the besieged port city of Mariupol Ukrainian officials accused Russia of carrying out a war crime. At the time of the strike - which Russia denies carrying out - the word children was written in giant letters on the ground outside the building. Ukraine previously called Russias air strike on Mariupols hospital a war crime. Three people were killed and 17 staff and patients were injured. Russian troops are also accused of targeting fleeing civilians. Theres mounting evidence that cluster bombs - munitions that separate into lots of bomblets - have hit civilian areas of Kharkiv. IMAGE SOURCE PRIVATE/HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH Image caption Apparent evidence of a cluster bomb sub-munition in Kharkiv passed to Human Rights Watch The UK says Russia has used thermobaric explosives which create a massive vacuum by sucking up oxygen. These are not banned but their deliberate use near civilians would almost certainly break the rules of war. Many experts argue the invasion itself is a crime under the concept of aggressive warfare. Putin has carried out war crimes - Boris Johnson How are suspected war criminals pursued? Each country has a duty to investigate suspected war crimes. Some nations do so more than others. In the UK senior police officers have offered to help gather evidence of potential crimes in Ukraine. How can suspected war criminals be prosecuted? There have been a series of one-off courts since World War Two - including the tribunal investigating war crimes during the break-up of Yugoslavia. A body was also set up to prosecute those responsible for the 1994 Rwanda genocide. IMAGE SOURCE AFP Image caption Théoneste Bagosora died while serving a 35-year sentence for his role in the 1994 Rwandan genocide Today the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) have roles upholding the rules of war. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) rules on disputes between states but cannot prosecute individuals. Ukraine has begun a case against Russia. If the ICJ ruled against Russia the UN Security Council (UNSC) would be responsible for enforcing that. But Russia - one of councils five permanent members - could veto any proposal to sanction it. The International Criminal Court (ICC) The ICC investigates and prosecutes individual war criminals who are not before the courts of individual states. Its the permanent modern successor to Nuremberg which prosecuted key Nazi leaders in 1945. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Nazis prosecuted at the Nuremberg trials included Hermann Goring Rudolf Hess and Joachim von Ribbentrop Nuremberg cemented the principle that nations could set up a special court to uphold international law. Can the ICC prosecute offences in Ukraine? The ICCs chief prosecutor British lawyer Karim Khan QC says there is a reasonable basis to believe war crimes have been carried out in Ukraine. Investigators will look at past and present allegations - going back as far as 2013 before Russias annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. If theres evidence the prosecutor will ask ICC judges to issue arrest warrants to bring individuals to trial in The Hague. But there are practical limitations to its power. The court doesnt have its own police force so relies on individual states to arrest suspects. Like the US Russia is not a member of the court - it pulled out in 2016. President Putin wont extradite any suspects. If a suspect went to another country they could be arrested - but thats a very big if. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Could President Putin or other leaders be prosecuted? Its far easier to pin a war crime on a soldier who commits it than the leader who ordered it. But the ICC can also prosecute the offence of waging aggressive war. This is the crime of an unjustified invasion or conflict beyond justifiable military action in self-defence. It originated at Nuremberg after the judge sent by Moscow convinced the Allies that Nazi leaders should face justice for crimes against peace. However Professor Philippe Sands QC an expert on international law at University College London says the ICC couldnt prosecute Russias leaders for this because the country isnt a signatory to the court. In theory the UN Security Council could ask the ICC to investigate this offence. But again Russia could veto this. So is there any other way to prosecute individuals? The effectiveness of the ICC - and the way international law plays out in practice - depend not just on treaties but politics and diplomacy. And Prof Sands and many other experts argue that like Nuremberg the solution lies once more in diplomacy and international agreement. Hes calling for world leaders to set up a one-off tribunal to prosecute the crime of aggression in Ukraine.

Ukraine war: Russia says it will curb Kyiv assault as peace talks progress,"Moscow says it will ""drastically reduce"" operations around the capital, Kyiv, as well as Chernihiv.",Ukraine war: Russia says it will curb Kyiv assault as peace talks progress Published 4 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption Moscow also pledged to curtail the assault on Chernihiv which has been encircled by Russian forces Russia has announced it will drastically reduce military combat operations in two key areas of Ukraine to boost mutual trust in peace talks. The decision to scale back operations around the capital Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv is the first sign of tangible progress from talks. But it is unclear how extensive any reduction in military activity might be and Ukraine remains sceptical. The US and UK also said the pledge should be treated with caution. On Tuesday Russia\s deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin said the country would radically by several times reduce the military activity around Kyiv and Chernihiv. He added that there had been progress on the neutrality and non-nuclear status of Ukraine which are two key concerns for Moscow. But Russia\s pledge to scale back its forces was met with scepticism. Ukrainians are not naive people President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an overnight video address. We can say that the signals... are positive but those signals do not drown out the explosions or Russian shells he added. We\ve only seen a small number begin to move away from Kyiv Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said adding that people should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine. The UK Defence Ministry also warned that Russia will likely seek to divert combat power from the north to their offensive in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east. Russia has already refocused its campaign on Ukraines eastern regions. It has suffered a series of setbacks to the north of the capital Kyiv and is also seeking to capture a land corridor which stretches along the south coast to the Russian border. The key word - scepticism The discussions lasted about three hours. Very little was leaked and nearly all media were kept away in a packed area on a pavement. The key points became clear as members of the Ukrainian delegation came out onto the street an hour before the expected finish. The negotiators said they had proposed to Russia that Ukraine adopt a neutral status in exchange for security guarantees - an international mechanism where guarantor countries would act to protect Ukraine in future. In return Kyiv would not join Nato a key Russian demand. This was not a new pledge but it was spelt out in the clearest detail yet. Many are sceptical about what Russias announcement about reducing military operations actually means; whether its a pledge to pull back or merely an acceptance it has already failed in those areas and will instead turn its full force further east. Western countries therefore are saying they will judge Russia by its actions and not its words. Read more from Tom here. During the ceasefire talks on Tuesday Ukraine proposed to become a neutral state in exchange for security guarantees. A key aim of Russias invasion was to stop Ukraine joining the Nato alliance and Russian officials said the talks had moved to a practical stage. Ukrainian negotiator Oleksandr Chaly told reporters that its offer of neutrality - which means it would not ally itself militarily with others - was a chance to restore the territorial integrity and security of Ukraine through diplomatic and political means. Russian forces have encircled Chernihiv where officials say up to 400 people have been killed and some 130000 residents are without heating electricity or water supplies. Russia\s chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said talks had been meaningful and Ukraine\s proposals on neutrality would be put to President Vladimir Putin. However he made clear that before a presidential summit could happen a treaty would have to be drafted and approved by negotiators and then signed by foreign ministers. This is not a ceasefire but this is our aspiration gradually to reach a de-escalation of the conflict at least on these fronts Mr Medinsky told Russian state news agency Tass.

The Times the Guardian and the i all lead on the warning from Ukraines top intelligence official that President Vladimir Putin wants to split the country in two. The Times says the idea would be a way for the Kremlin to cut its losses but the i reports that Ukraine has warned it would retaliate with guerrilla warfare. The Telegraph also leads with the war but concentrates on what it calls the international backlash to a speech by President Joe Biden in which he appeared to suggest that President Putin could not remain in power. The paper says the comment put his relations with Western allies under strain while fuelling the Kremlins claim that Russia is faced with an existential threat from the West. The Financial Times fears that the unity of the US the EU and Nato could begin to fray. The Express says there could be a new council tax cut on the way for millions of people struggling with the rising cost of living. The paper says the chancellor has been forced to look at additional ways to help households following criticism over the lack of measures in his Spring Statement last week. A number of papers concentrate on the fallout from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridges tour of Belize Jamaica and the Bahamas which was overshadowed by questions about the future role of the Royal Family in the Caribbean. The Mail says Prince William wants to modernise the monarchy by ending its long-standing never complain never explain policy. Under the headline A Battle of Wills the Mirror says the prince wants to use his voice to confront criticism of what it calls a blunder-hit trip.

Cricket writers consider Englands crushing loss to the West Indies in the deciding Test of their three-match series. The Mirror says the 10-wicket surrender confirmed Englands place at the bottom of the World Test Championship.

The Guardian says speculation about Roots future as captain is at fever pitch.

Ukraine war: What next for the African students who fled?,The thousands who left are now faced with a decision about where to continue their studies.,Ukraine war: What next for the African students who fled? By Soraya Ali BBC News Published 4 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE DESMOND MUOKWUDO Image caption Desmond Chinaza Muokwudo was a welder in Nigeria before studying in Ukraine Desmond Chinaza Muokwudo a 30-year-old Nigerian student who has recently fled Ukraine spent 11 years saving up for an education in Europe. Once a pipeline welder from Anambra state he dreamt of studying international relations - but he struggled with unemployment amid a recession in 2016. It was only after his parents decided to sell their small plot of land that he managed to raise enough funds to pursue his dream. He finally enrolled last year at university and had only spent three months in Ukraine when Russia launched its full-scale invasion. My parents have nothing left they can\t support me he explained over the phone from his temporary accommodation in Berlin Germany sounding defeated. My government just tells me to come back home but there\s nothing waiting for me in Nigeria. Mr Muokwudo is one of the estimated 16000 African students who were living in Ukraine and are now scrambling to continue their studies. Many had a traumatic time fleeing amid reports of racial abuse at the border. Media caption Nigerian student who fled Ukraine: They are only helping Ukrainians. Hundreds have returned home on repatriation flights though exact numbers are unclear but thousands like Mr Muokwudo are likely to still be in Europe. I have sacrificed too much to get here. I have to stay in Europe and I have to get an education Mr Muokwudo said. Universities across the world have extended a helping hand to students fleeing Ukraine in the form of guaranteed places discounted tuition fees and relaxed visa requirements. African officials have also increased diplomatic efforts to get assurances for their students with foreign ministers meeting with their European counterparts to broker deals. Up to 250 university places are being offered in Hungary to stranded medical students according to Ghanaian officials - and Ghanas government reportedly has a deal with Grenada for 200 to be enrolled at the St Georges University of Medicine. Semmelweis University in Hungary which is allowing medical students to continue their studies for free until the war is over says it has received more than 2000 applications in just a few weeks mainly from Africans. However many students say that these offers are granted on a case-by-case basis and wrapped up in red tape. They largely depend on what degree students are undertaking how many years they have already completed and how much they can still afford to pay. Mr Muokwudo complained that some universities would not take non-Ukrainians. \We only take Ukrainian citizens\ that\s what I\ve been told he said referring to a policy at Tallinn University in Estonia. The university confirmed that only Ukrainians could apply outside the usual admission process but said that international students were still welcome to apply the regular way. Online seminars The war has left many of these students with difficult choices - and left some with the prospect of not qualifying. Nigeria has welcomed back more than 1000 people mainly students from Ukraine according to a government tally. Among them was 22-year-old medical student Fehintola Moses Damilola who was trapped in the besieged city of Sumy for weeks. I\m just happy to be safe and with my parents he said speaking to the BBC from his home in Oyo state. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Some universities in Ukraine - this is one in Kharkiv - are trying to continue classes online despite the war It is his first visit home in more than five years - and he is just one semester away from becoming a qualified doctor. This is still likely to happen as he is lucky to be able to rely on online classes which despite the ongoing conflict some Ukrainian universities are offering using the digital infrastructure developed during pandemic lockdowns. In Nigerias Kaduna state Firdausi Mohammed Usman has also begun online classes. The 22-year-old medical student is in her fifth year at the National Medical University in Kharkiv an eastern Ukrainian city that has faced nightly shelling. She said that the professors were holding online practical seminars and some appeared on the screen. Her teachers are being understandably tight-lipped about their exact location for safety reasons. Some have fled the country but others are still in Ukraine and leaving basement bomb shelters to host classes upstairs. They don\t want us to all drop out or transfer somewhere else - otherwise the university might be forced to close down forever. We don\t have access to our transcripts academic records] so this is the best option for now. I dont want to go backwards Mr Damilola who was president of the Nigerian Students Union in Sumy also stressed the importance of online classes for medical students in their final year like him. IMAGE SOURCE FEHINTOLA MOSES DAMILOLA Image caption Fehintola Moses Damilola seen here on right with fellow students had been in Ukraine since he was 17 It might be hard with this internet but I only have one semester left and I can\t afford to start at a new university he said struggling to be heard as the WhatsApp line kept breaking up. He also felt that finishing his degree in Nigeria would mean going backwards academically. Marcel Chidera from Nigerias Enugu state is continuing his education in Poland having turned down a repatriation flight organised by his government. He is not the only one. Angola arranged a flight for its citizens to return home from Warsaw. It expected to take home 277 people but only 30 boarded. Going back home without a degree was not an option Mr Chidera said from his temporary accommodation in the Polish capital. The 25-year-old counted himself lucky as he had only completed a Ukrainian language course so was free to start a new degree. Most courses in Poland are offered in English and open to international students though the costs and admission requirements are often tougher than in Ukraine. He has found a discounted business management degree at a Polish university - and considered himself better off than others in his family in Nigeria where university lecturers have been on a nationwide strike since 14 February. My siblings are studying in Nigeria right now. They\re not even in classes because of the strikes he said. Opportunity for Africa Higher education across Africa has long suffered from insufficient funding a shortage of qualified staff and low investment in research and development according to local NGOs and UN agencies. Only 60 African universities made the top 1500 listed globally according to World University Rankings. South Africa home to the continents top universities has stepped up efforts to help returning students. Dr Mamphela Ramphele the former vice-chancellor of the University of Cape Town the highest-ranking school in Africa called it an opportunity to rethink the way we address support to young people. That sentiment has appealed to students like Zoe Inutu in Zambia who are searching for options at home. She was two years into her public relations degree in Zaporizhzhia south-east Ukraine when the war began. My transcripts are stuck in Ukraine so I will probably have to start a new degree she said. I will go anywhere that will take me including Africa as long as I am safe.

Russia-Ukraine war: Abramovich spotted in Istanbul peace talks,"The Russian billionaire was seen as the talks began, following reports that he suffered poisoning symptoms.",Russia-Ukraine war: Abramovich spotted in Istanbul peace talks Published 4 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE TURKISH TV Image caption Roman Abramovich is seen sitting at a table alongside Ibrahim Kalin - a spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has appeared at peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey. He was seen talking to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who is mediating in the talks in Istanbul. Reports surfaced hours earlier that Mr Abramovich and two Ukrainian negotiators had shown poisoning symptoms after talks in early March. Mr Abramovich is known to have spent weeks in a mediation role flying between Moscow and Kyiv. The Chelsea football club owner was said to have suffered sore eyes and peeling skin but had now recovered reports say. A Wall Street Journal report suggested he and the Ukrainian negotiators had been targeted by Russian hardliners in Kyiv on 3 March but a Ukrainian presidential official later said the two Ukrainians were fine and one had said the story was false. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov poured scorn on the report on Tuesday as untrue and part of an information war. Ukraines Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba however told national TV hours before the talks that he had advised his colleagues attending negotiations with Russia not to eat or drink anything. Russian state news agency Ria Novosti released a picture showing Mr Abramovich talking to the Turkish president and Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu at the meeting. Абрамович встретился с Эрдоганом перед переговорами России и Украиныhttps://t.co/ppLsELEJlV pic.twitter.com/AOayvuPdmF — РИА Новости (@rianru) March 29 2022 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter He was also spotted in Turkish TV coverage listening to a translation wearing headphones sitting alongside Mr Erdogans spokesman Ibrahim Kalin. They were not at the main table of the Russian and Ukrainian delegations. The exact nature of Mr Abramovichs role in the talks is unclear although Ukrainian media said he was there as a neutral party. The Kremlin spokesman stressed he was not an official member of the Russian delegation in Istanbul but had been involved in enabling contacts between the two delegations. Ukraine\s UK ambassador Vadym Prystaiko was scathing about his presence in Istanbul: I have no idea what Mr Abramovich is claiming or doing. He is not a part of the negotiation team he told the BBC. I don\t know if he\s buying his way out somehow or if he\s really useful that\s very difficult to tell. The businessmans yacht Eclipse has been seen moored at the Turkish port of Marmaris in recent days.

Mr Abramovich who has Israeli citizenship reportedly flew from Tel Aviv to Moscow by private jet on 14 March 11 days after the alleged incident in Kyiv. A number of enemies of the Kremlin have suffered mysterious poisonings in recent years including Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny who was attacked with a nerve agent in Siberia and activist activist Vladimir Kara-Murza who survived two incidents. The Kremlin denied any involvement. In Ukraine in 2004 pro-European presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko survived an attack with dioxins that disfigured his face. Russia denied any involvement.

How the sex trade preys on Ukraine's refugees,Trafficking rings are notoriously active in and around Ukraine - and the fog of war is perfect cover.,How the sex trade preys on Ukraines refugees Katya Adler Europe editor @BBCkatyaadler on Twitter Published 7 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption Refugees are forced to put their trust in strangers Five weeks into Russias brutal invasion of Ukraine imagine for a moment what its like to live there now. Bombs bloodshed trauma. No school for your children no healthcare for your parents no safe roof over your head in many parts of the country. Would you try to run? Ten million Ukrainians have according to the United Nations. Most seek refuge in other areas of Ukraine believed to be safer. But more than three and a half million people have fled over the border. They are mainly women and children as men under the age of 60 are obliged by the Ukrainian government to stay put and fight. Displaced and disoriented often with no idea where to go next refugees are forced to put their trust in strangers. The chaos of war is now behind them but the truth is theyre not entirely safe outside Ukraine either. For predators and human traffickers the war in Ukraine is not a tragedy UN Secretary General António Guterres warned on Twitter. It\s an opportunity - and women and children are the targets. Trafficking rings are notoriously active in Ukraine and neighbouring countries in peace time. The fog of war is perfect cover to increase business. Karolina Wierzbińska a coordinator at Homo Faber a human rights organisation based in Lublin told me children were a huge concern. Many youngsters were travelling out of Ukraine unaccompanied she said. Patchy registration processes in Poland and other border regions - especially at the start of the war - meant children disappeared their current whereabouts unknown. My colleagues and I headed down to the Polish-Ukrainian border to see for ourselves. At a train station well known for refugee arrivals we found a hive of activity. Dazed-looking women and crying children were all around. Image caption Women and their children have been arriving at the border area Many were being comforted and offered hot food from steaming industrial-sized cooking pots by an army of volunteers wearing high-vis gilets. So far so well organised right? Not quite. We met Margherita Husmanov a Ukrainian refugee from Kyiv in her early 20s. She arrived at the border two weeks ago but decided to stay on to help stop fellow refugees falling into the wrong hands. I asked her if she felt vulnerable. Yes she told me. That\s especially why I worry about their safety. The women and children come here from a terrible war. They don\t speak Polish or English. They don\t know what\s going on and they believe what anyone tells them. Anyone can turn up at this station. The first day I volunteered we saw three men from Italy. They were looking for beautiful women to sell into the sex trade. I called the police and it turned out I was right. It wasn\t paranoia. It\s horrible. Image caption Margherita Husmanov is a refugee turned volunteer Margherita says local officials are a bit more organised now. Police regularly patrol the station. The people (mainly men were told) with cardboard signs to tempting destinations so present in the first couple of weeks of refugee arrivals have largely disappeared. But as we find out from a number of sources other ill-intentioned individuals are now posing as high-vis-wearing volunteers. Elena Moskvitina spoke out on Facebook to raise awareness. Shes now safely in Denmark so we chatted at length via Skype. Her experience is chilling. She and her children crossed into neighbouring Romania from war-torn Ukraine. They were looking for a lift away from the border. What she described as fake volunteers at a refugee centre asked where she was staying. They turned up later in the day and aggressively told her Switzerland was the best place to go and that theyd give her a lift there with a van full of other women. Elena told me the men looked at her and her daughter sleazily. Her daughter was petrified. They asked her to show them her son who was in another room. They looked him up and down she said. They then insisted she travel with no-one else except them and they got angry when she asked to see their ID cards. To get the men away from her family Elena promised to meet them when the other women were in their van. But as soon as they left she told me she grabbed her children and ran. Image caption Elżbieta Jarmulska offers safe passage to Ukrainian refugees Elżbieta Jarmulska a feisty Polish entrepreneur is the founder of the Women Take The Wheel Initiative. Her aim she says is to provide Ukrainian refugees with a bubble of safety. Those women have been through so much already walking or driving their way through a war zone and then they are exposed to fear and exploitation here? I have no words for what that must be like she says. By now she has recruited more than 650 Polish amazing women as she describes them driving backwards and forwards as often as they can to the Polish-Ukrainian border in order to offer refugees safe passage. I accompany Elżbieta better known as Ela to a refugee centre where she makes a point of showing her ID card and proof of residence to officials before she asks if anyone wants a lift to Warsaw. Her car was full in moments. The passengers: refugee Nadia and her three children. Ela settled the family into her thoughtfully stocked car offering the small children water chocolate and motion-sickness tablets if they needed them. Image caption Nadia and her children are grateful for the lift Nadia meanwhile told me of her dangerous journey out of Ukraine from Kharkiv. Now in Poland she was so relieved she said to have a female driver. Shed heard of the risks of trafficking and exploitation on Ukrainian radio. But she came anyway. Her home was being shelled she said. The risks of war were more immediate. Ela has the refugees best interests at heart. But leaving the border safely doesnt mean the danger is over for them. Most we spoke to hoped to go home as soon as the violence ends. But over the next days weeks even months they need somewhere to sleep to eat to send their children to school as well as a job to properly support themselves. Those needs make refugees vulnerable. EU leaders have unanimously approved a measure to open up the job market schools and access to health care for Ukrainians but as human rights groups point out refugees need help to get registered and be informed of their rights. One of the volunteers I met at the Polish-Ukrainian border told me that when youre down and out friendless and in need of money you can all too easily end up doing things you would have never imagined. This woman was lured into prostitution when she was younger. And that she says is a large part of the reason shes helping Ukrainian refugees now. I want to protect them. To warn them she told me. She asked me not to reveal her name. She\s since turned her life around and doesn\t want her children to know about her past. Image caption Refugees are all too vulnerable to exploitation Five weeks into Russias onslaught in Ukraine processes across Europe screening those claiming to help Ukrainians are still far from foolproof. Organised crime (including sex and organ trafficking and frequently slave labour) is not the only menace. Refugees are exploited by individuals too. People in Poland Germany the UK and elsewhere have opened up their homes to refugees most with the best of intentions. But sadly not all. We found a post on social media from a Ukrainian woman who fled to Düsseldorf in Germany. The man who offered her a room confiscated her ID papers and demanded she clean his house for free. He then started to make sexual advances as well. She refused - and he kicked her out on the street. Irena Dawid-Olczyk chief executive of the Warsaw branch of anti-trafficking NGO La Strada told me the story was all too familiar. That kind of thing happens war or no war she told me. But an avalanche of conflict-scarred women and children bursting out of Ukraine means that exploitation and abuse cases escalate. She cites teenage refugees as a particular concern. We all know teenagers don\t we? They\re insecure. They want acceptance and recognition she says. And if they are refugees who are far from home and friends they\re even easier to exploit. Girls might love attention lavished on them by older men. Or they\ll be introduced to a cool girl their own age who has great clothes and invites them to parties. That\s how it starts. Don\t forget it\s not only men who are pimps traffickers and abusers. Image caption Refugees are given leaflets offering help The push factors for Ukrainian women to accept seemingly generous online offers to escape their difficulties also increase manyfold in war time. Without revealing identities Irena reels off case after case that La Strada Poland is working on - Ukrainian girls offered plane tickets to Mexico Turkey the UAE without ever having met the men inviting them. My colleagues are trying to persuade a 19-year-old girl not to join her friend at a man\s house she says. She knows her friend has been beaten. But the man calls her on her mobile says sweet things and offers her presents. If they insist on going we beg the girls to at least register with the local authorities. If they don\t they have our phone number. I hope they can call us if they need us. Governments across Europe have pledged solidarity with Ukraine. Human rights groups want them to take better care of those running for their lives. They need protection.]

Harry Richardson a teacher from Leek in Staffordshire moved to the country three years ago after marrying his wife Alina a Ukrainian national. After sheltering in a basement they escaped the fighting to Moldova on 3 March returning home at the weekend. Mr Richardson said he had been marked by the cruelty he had seen but was touched by the community response. I never thought I would be in a war he said. That was the furthest from my imagination. What my wife and I have seen are things we never wanted to see... You see that cruelty but at the other end of the scale you also see how that can also bring out the kindness of people the compassion the humanity. Image caption Mr Richardson said he will continue to campaign for more support for victims of the war Mr Richardson and his family took refuge in a university basement in Uman sometimes for up to nine hours at a time. When I went down those stairs into the bunker for the first time I stood there and I looked and I thought: I\m on a film set because that\s exactly what it was like. For the first couple of days of the war it didn\t seem real that we were sitting in a bunker with 80-90 other people he said.

From left: Kieran Perkins Elliot Davies and CJ Darton The road to war for CJ Elliott and Kieran ran through Facebook a cheap flight to Poland and a cold night sleeping outside a railway station. We meet the former British soldiers in Ukraine just outside a school a couple of kilometres from the border with Poland. They are waiting for a minibus to transport them along with other recruits to Lviv. I just can\t sit at home and watch what\s going on and carry on as usual says CJ Darton who served for seven years with the Royal Anglian Regiment. When Russia invaded Ukraine in February he almost immediately began making plans to volunteer. If you\re not fighting in someone else\s street does it end up in yours? Do my kids become a target? Do my mates\ kids? Between them the three men have 19 years of experience in the British military and all did tours in Afghanistan. After exchanging messages online they met for the first time at Stansted airport as they waited to catch a £20 Ryanair flight to the Polish city of Krakow. We were stopped by police on the way out recounts Kieran Perkins 35 who works as a plumber near Brighton. They said \fair play to you\. As far as I\m aware we\re not doing anything wrong. Plans in secret Hundreds of former British soldiers who have completed their time in the armed services have said they want to go to Ukraine to fight or help with medical or humanitarian efforts. Many told the BBC earlier this month that they are getting mixed messages from the government about whether they should go. The legal position at home is vague. In February Foreign Secretary Liz Truss encouraged people to go only for Downing Street to advise people with no combat experience not to. The Ministry of Defence meanwhile says it may be against the law and could lead to prosecution. That first night in Poland the men slept out outside Przemyśl railway station before walking across into Ukraine the following morning. Elliott Davies a construction worker from Colchester Essex and CJ had both told their families where they were going. Kieran a father of four had not. The former armoured vehicle driver with the Princess of Wales Royal Regiment didnt tell the childrens mothers he says trying to suppress a smile. I didn\t even tell my mum. I just thought because I\m only away for a short period of time... I didn\t want to worry anyone. BBC Where will it stop? Who else could suffer if we dont do something? Elliot Former Grenadier Guardsman Kieran is not planning on a long war. He only wants to stay in Ukraine for two or three weeks before returning home explaining that he has childcare responsibilities and a birthday coming up. I\m not expecting to get to the front line in that time. But if everyone chips in to help then it takes the weight off the people that are really working hard right at the front line. By contrast Elliott says hes in Ukraine for as long as it takes. I\ll help out wherever I can in the field he says. Anywhere from back to front. Bearded with long curly hair the 28-year-old served for seven years with the Grenadier Guards and says he is ready if necessary to die in Ukraine. Where will it stop? Who else could suffer if we don\t do something? Locals gratitude Also waiting by the side of the road is an American ex-marine Nate Vance.

Thank you very much that you have come here to help she tells them. Our Ukrainian soldiers are also very brave very brave. The men now have a choice to make. One option is to sign up with Ukraines International Legion. That could mean committing to stay for the duration of the war. In return theyd get paid the same as rank-and-file Ukrainian soldiers. A more flexible choice is to remain unattached and link up with other British former soldiers who are already fighting at the front line bypassing what might turn out to be painful Ukrainian bureaucracy. As they prepare to leave I ask whether it was the excitement of war that had brought them to Ukraine. Anyone who thinks we\re war junkies or war tourists needs to stick to watching the news CJ says.

Ukraine calls for Nepal to ban Russian climbers from Himalayas,Nepal has issued permits to nine Russian climbers despite a Ukrainian call for them to be banned.,Ukraine calls for Nepal to ban Russian climbers from Himalayas By Navin Singh Khadka Environment correspondent BBC World Service Published 4 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Mountaineers pictured during their ascent to the summit of Mount Everest Nine Russians have been given permits to climb peaks in Nepal this spring despite calls from Ukrainian diplomats and mountaineers for them to be banned after President Putin sent troops into Ukraine. A diplomatic note from the Ukrainian embassy in Delhi to Nepals government says numerous international sports federations have barred Russian athletes. Taking into consideration the above the esteemed Nepalese side is kindly requested to ban Russian mountaineering teams until the end of the] Russian invasion into Ukraine the letter reads. But officials in Nepal say they are continuing to issue permits to anyone abiding by the governments rules and regulations There has been no change in our policy so far the director general of Nepal\s tourism department Taranath Adhikari told the BBC. We believe our mountains are global assets and any countries\ citizens willing to visit them for attainment of peace should be allowed to do so - as long as they do it within our legal provisions. The Ukrainian embassy in Delhi says it made its request to the Nepalese embassy in the Indian capital on 21 March but Nepalese embassy officials told the BBC they had received no communication on the issue. For the spring climbing season which usually lasts until the end of May one Russian climber has received a permit to climb Annapurna I (8091m) while eight others have been given permits for peaks below 6500m. We have carried on with our usual policy. Moreover the government has not said anything in this regard so we have not taken any new decision says Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA) president Santa Bir Lama. IMAGE SOURCE OLEG IVANCHENKO Image caption Russian and Ukrainian climbers have climbed Himalayan peaks together in the past Irina Galay who describes herself as the first Ukrainian woman to ascend Everest and K2 the world\s highest and second highest mountains wrote on Instagram that Russians should not have the privilege of climbing as long as war is continued. No peace no climb. Hopefully soon we will have peace and climb. Oleg Ivanchenko a Ukrainian mountain guide was planning to climb Mount Everest and Mount Lhotse this spring with two of his clients but had to cancel after the Russian invasion. I know some people say mountains are sacred and it is not a place for politics but we expect support from Russian mountaineers as well and they can protest - or at least not climb and stay in Russia he says. No Ukrainian climbers are now expected this spring. We had around 35 climbers from Ukraine coming in for different mountains including Everest but all of them have cancelled says Mingma Sherpa chairman of Seven Summit Treks a mountaineering and trekking operator in Nepal. We have seen cancellations from Russians as well as other European climbers because of the war. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Expedition operators in Nepal say they are neutral while dealing with mountaineers of all nationalities Nepals department of tourism has so far issued permits for 18 expedition teams to climb mountains above 6000m this spring season. Of the 135 climbers in these teams only one is from Russia. More permits may be issued before mountaineers usually begin their final ascent in May so the total number could change. However expedition operators say the war has caused a significant decline in business. Last year in the spring and autumn climbing seasons 49 Russians and 19 Ukrainians were registered on Nepalese mountains higher than 8000m according to the Himalayan Database which records data related to mountaineering in the Nepalese Himalayas. Out of them 14 Russian and six Ukrainian climbers were on Everest. A record number of more than 400 foreign climbers were given permits for Everest alone in 2021. But permits have been issued for only three Everest expedition of 16 climbers this spring season which is traditionally busier than the autumn. Officials with the Expedition Operators Association of Nepal say they are neutral while dealing with mountaineers. We are professional operators and we serve our clients irrespective of their nationalities says association president Dambar Parajuli.

Ukraine war: Dozens of Russian diplomats expelled by four EU nations,"More than 40 diplomats are told to leave by Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland and the Czech Republic.",Ukraine war: Dozens of Russian diplomats expelled by four EU nations Published 4 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmès told MPs that 21 Russian diplomats will be expelled In a co-ordinated move four EU countries are expelling more than 40 Russian diplomats suspected of spying. Ireland Belgium the Netherlands and the Czech Republic issued expulsion orders to a total of 43 embassy staffers on Tuesday afternoon. The move follows similar actions taken by other EU members including Poland in the past week. Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmès told MPs that the expulsions were related to our national security. Speaking to parliament Ms Wilmès said that 21 members of staff at the Russian embassy in Brussels and at the consulate in Antwerp had been asked to leave the country giving them two weeks to depart. She added that the move was made in conjunction with Belgium\s neighbour the Netherlands whose foreign ministry said it was expelling 17 Russian diplomats it considered to be secretly active as intelligence officers. Irelands Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Micheál Martin told MPs that his government had expelled four Russian diplomats after receiving security advice from its intelligence officials. Mr Martin said the officials had been asked to leave the state because their activities are not in accordance with the international standards of diplomatic behaviour. Russia\s embassy in Dublin said it rejected the groundless decision adding that it would deteriorate further Russian-Irish relations. Meanwhile a Czech official told the AFP news agency that the diplomat expelled from Prague was Russias deputy ambassador. Together with our Allies we are reducing the Russian intelligence presence in the EU the Czech foreign ministry tweeted. On Wednesday Poland expelled 45 accredited diplomats for engaging in suspected espionage in the country. Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski wrote on Twitter that Polish intelligence officials were dismantling the Russian special services network in our country. And earlier this month Bulgaria Lithuania Latvia and Estonia expelled a total of 20 Russian embassy staffers in connection with activities contrary to their diplomatic status. Russia has tended to respond to such decisions with reciprocal moves and earlier today announced the expulsion of 10 diplomats from Estonia Latvia and Lithuania.

Ukraine war: Five wounded after explosions hit western city of Lviv,Lviv has become a hub for thousands of refugees fleeing other parts of Ukraine since Russia's invasion.,Ukraine war: Five wounded after explosions hit western city of Lviv Published 26 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Thick black smoke could be seen rising from the area that was hit on the outskirts of Lviv Several explosions hit the city of Lviv in western Ukraine regional officials said. The governor of the Lviv region Maksym Kozytskyi said five people had been injured and that rocket fire had hit a fuel storage facility and a factory. Lviv has so far escaped much of the shelling that has come to be a part of daily life in other parts of Ukraine. It has also become a hub for hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing other parts of the country. The alleged Russian attack came as US President Joe Biden delivered a speech in Warsaw Poland some 250 miles (400km) from Lviv. In it he addressed the Russian people on their leader President Vladimir Putin telling them: For God\s sake this man cannot remain in power. The Kremlin responded that was not for the US leader to say. That\s not for Biden to decide. The president of Russia is elected by Russians a spokesman said. A White House official later said that Mr Biden was not calling for regime change but making the point that Vladimir Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours in the region. Lviv\s mayor Andriy Sadoviy said that with today\s blows the aggressor sends greetings to President Biden who is in Poland Reuters news agency reports. In other developments in Ukraine today: The city of Slavutych where many of Chernobyls nuclear power plants workers live was taken by Russian troops according to the regional governor.

Then three powerful explosions and thick plumes of smoke could be seen from the distance. Hours later another attack. It all happened a day after Russia said it was focusing its invasion of Ukraine on the east. Lviv is in the extreme opposite. And this distance from the worst of Russias aggression where people have been under unrelenting bombing and shelling turned this city into something like a safe heaven. Displaced people humanitarian workers volunteers. They are all here. That perception could be changing. Maryanna Pack a 39-year-old economist who was near the site of the blast gave a passionate testimony that may be a view shared by many. We\re feeling unprotected. Nobody really cares about what\s happening here she said. We need more help now. Eastern Ukraine has been completely destroyed. It\s really possible that could happen to Lviv and the west of the country too. Image caption Maryanna Pack who saw the explosion said we need more help now As bombs fell on Lviv and other cities across Ukraine President Biden referred to his Russian counterpart as a butcher. The comment was made during a meeting with Ukrainian refugees helping with the humanitarian relief effort in Poland - where more than two million Ukrainian refugees have now fled. A spokesperson for Mr Putin cited by Russian state news agency Tass said the comment narrowed the prospects for mending ties between the two countries. Earlier Mr Biden met Ukraines foreign and defence ministers Dmytro Kuleba and Oleksii Reznikov. The two Ukrainians ministers trip out of Ukraine to Poland was seen as a possible sign that confidence in Ukraines fightback against Russia is growing. During the talks the US\s unwavering commitment to Ukraine\s sovereignty and territorial integrity was discussed according to a US state department spokesperson. Mr Biden also stressed the sacred commitment to Nato\s collective defence after meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda. You can count on that... for your freedom and ours he told Mr Duda.]

Sources close to the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich said he had suffered symptoms of a suspected poisoning following peace talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border earlier this month. The Chelsea FC owner - who has now recovered - reportedly suffered sore eyes and peeling skin. A report in the Wall Street Journal said the alleged poisoning was orchestrated by hardliners in Russia who wanted to sabotage the talks. Both Ukrainian and American officials have played down the reports. However our security correspondent Frank Gardner says it would hardly be surprising that the US would want to dampen down suggestions that anyone - especially Russia - had used a chemical weapon in Ukraine as this could push them into retaliatory action that they are extremely reluctant to take. You can read the full story here: Abramovich suffered suspected poisoning at talks Zelensky open to neutrality in talks IMAGE SOURCE HO VIA EPA Image caption Zelensky said any such deal would have to be put to a referendum in Ukraine Earlier in the day President Volodymyr Zelensky said his government was prepared to discuss adopting a neutral status as part of a peace deal with Russia. Neutrality means a country does not ally itself militarily with others. In an interview with independent Russian journalists Mr Zelensky said any such deal would have to be put to a referendum in Ukraine. He has made similar comments before but rarely so forcefully. The news comes as the negotiations between the two countries are set to resume on Tuesday in Turkey. Security guarantees and neutrality non-nuclear status of our state. We are ready to go for it. This is the most important point Mr Zelensky said in the 90-minute video call. Read more here. Anti-war Russians intimidated on their doorsteps IMAGE SOURCE DARYA KHEIKINEN Image caption Darya Kheikinens apartment door was vandalised two nights in a row Russian activists and journalists speaking out against their country\s so-called special military operation in Ukraine have had their homes vandalised by unknown pro-Kremlin figures. Apartment doors have been daubed with threatening graffiti labelling the people inside a traitor with messages featuring the letter Z - a pro-Kremlin symbol of Russia\s war in Ukraine. Other examples are even more extreme. In one case a leading Russian journalist discovered a pigs head wearing a wig on his doorstep with an anti-Semitic sticker stuck to his door. Alexei Venediktov the long-time editor of radio station Ekho of Moscow before it stopped broadcasting due to increased Russian censorship posted photos of the vandalism pointing out the irony of an anti-Semitic attack happening in the country that defeated fascism. Such vandalism is a sign of the increasingly intimidating atmosphere in Russia for those people who publicly express their opposition to the war in Ukraine. Read the story in full here. Russia accused of transferring thousands of civilians IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption Dozens of refugees are now housed in a sports centre in Taganrog Russia east of Mariupol Ukraine accused Russia of forcibly relocating thousands of civilians from Mariupol the strategic port city devastated by Russian shelling. Russia is housing an estimated 5000 at a temporary camp in Bezimenne east of Mariupol seen in satellite images. Ukraines Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said 40000 had been moved from Ukraine to Russian-held territory without any co-ordination with Kyiv. A Mariupol refugee now in Russia said: All of us were taken forcibly. Some Ukrainian officials describe Russia\s actions as deportations to filtration camps - an echo of Russia\s war in Chechnya when thousands of Chechens were brutally interrogated in makeshift camps and many disappeared.

Civilians trapped in Chernihiv IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption A school building that was partially destroyed by Russian shelling in the city earlier this month The northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv has been almost completely encircled by Russian forces and left without electricity gas or running water. Tens of thousands of people remain trapped. Some have described civilian buildings and residential areas being deliberately targeted. The strikes are so frequent that Anna and her husband take turns in watching the sky. He does the nights she does the mornings. The attacks are extremely loud. The building and windows shake a lot she said. It is impossible to sleep. Only when you\re exhausted because your brain just turns off. The couple and probably everyone else left in Chernihiv spend most of their time hiding behind thick walls. Thank God we have them Anna said. Their son who is 12 rarely ventures outside. He\s in panic. Many children are afraid of going out. Chernihiv located on the banks of the Desna River was one of the first targets for Russian troops who invaded Ukraine from Belarus hoping to quickly reach the capital Kyiv just 144km (90 miles) to the south. A month on that has not happened and they have now effectively surrounded the city. Civilians are trapped with no running water electricity and heating and under relentless bombing and shelling. And like Mariupol the besieged city on the Sea of Azov that has seen the worst of Russias brutality very little seems to remain untouched. Read the full story here.

The company said it restricted customer access to protect military users and critical infrastructure. Global internet monitor Netblocks said it was the most severe disruption to affect Ukrtelecom since Russias invasion of Ukraine started last month. Netblocks said it saw a collapse in connectivity to 13% of pre-war levels. However Ukrainian users on different internet providers who spoke to the BBC reported no problems. Ukrtelecom says it is the countrys biggest provider of fixed internet in terms of geographical coverage but second after Kyivstar in terms of number of clients. It told the BBC it had been operating at about 80% of its full coverage because of damage caused by the Russian invasion. In a statement Ukrtelecom chief executive Yuriy Kurmaz wrote that a powerful enemy cyber attack was carried out on Ukrtelecoms IT infrastructure. In order to protect the critical network infrastructure and not interrupt services to the Armed Forces other military bodies and users of critical infrastructure we were forced to temporarily restrict internet access to most private users and business customers he added. Mr Kurmaz said the attack had been successfully repulsed and the provision of services was being gradually resumed. IMAGE SOURCE UKRTELECOM Image caption Ukrtelecom engineers have kept working during the conflict Yuriy Shchyhol head of Ukraines State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection said that its specialists had responded quickly to the situation and had driven-back the attack. Before the company revealed details of the incident Alp Toker director of Netblocks told the BBC they had observed users falling offline progressively over the course of the day which indicates that the issue lies not with cabling or interconnections but rather with central infrastructure at the operator\s data centre. This can indicate a cyber-attack. ⚠️ Update: Ukraines national internet provider Ukrtelecom has confirmed a cyberattack on its core infrastructure.  Real-time network data show an ongoing and intensifying nation-scale disruption to service which is the most severe registered since the invasion by Russia. https://t.co/syej0wABYO — NetBlocks (@netblocks) March 28 2022 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Ukraine defence: Red lights and painted arrows fuel fear of Russian agents,"Fear of Russian saboteurs operating in Ukraine has soared, but is it based on intelligence and arrests?",Ukraine defence: Red lights and painted arrows fuel fear of Russian agents By Andrew Harding BBC News Odesa Ukraine Published 26 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption Bohdan had to make a police statement after a neighbour reported his fairy lights Suspicion thrives on conflict and after a month of war in Ukraine the fear that Russian saboteurs may be operating is hardening into a certainty. But how much is fact backed up by intelligence reports and arrests and how much is something closer to understandable paranoia fuelled by social media rumours about mysterious lights and signs? It was my neighbours from this stairwell who came to see me. They were scared about security said Bohdan Mylko a 22-year-old engineer sharing an apartment on the northern edge of Odesa. Fifteen minutes later the police were at his door asking about a red light in his bedroom window. It\s paranoia based on fake news about red lights being a sign to the Russians. I had to go to the police station and get my documents checked make a statement and get my photo taken. The police realised that I\m just a normal guy and let me go home. I\m not trying to help the Russians said Mylko holding up the set of flashing fairy lights that prompted the police\s intervention. Image caption Elderly people are among patrols at night asking to check the documents of people they encounter Moments after we visited him one evening shortly before curfew we were stopped on the street outside by a group of residents who asked to see our documents. You could be Russians said an elderly woman who gave her name as Valya. What are you doing here? We have small children. We don\t want anything to happen to them. Maybe someone will drop a bomb here tomorrow said another woman as the wail of an air raid siren rose over the apartment complex. Such concerns are understandable in a city and a country still reeling from the shock of Russias invasion. Similar behaviour has been noted in many other conflicts from Syria to Chechnya and beyond. This is not paranoia. There are Russian agents and citizens of Ukraine working against us. That\s a fact said Capt Volodymir Kalina from the Odesa police. But he acknowledged there was a strong element of disinformation involved and accused Russia of deliberately trying to stir up public fear. They\re trying to distract us to make us pay attention to the wrong places - to clear us from one part of the city so they can carry out their work in another area he said. Image caption Dmitro covered a black arrow on a wall in case it was a sign for Russian troops Along the coast a few kilometres south of Odesa citys historic centre in an area known for its nightclubs and beach bars retired businessman Dmitro Novak 71 was beginning his morning shift with a neighbourhood patrol. He pointed to a black arrow painted on a wall and explained he had covered it in case it was a sign for Russian troops. A few minutes later he stopped on a set of steps beside a large empty office building overlooking the sea. I saw a big light there. It was directed towards the night sky. My neighbours saw it too. It was on the roof of this building. For sure it was a signal to the Russian fleet. Some kind of signal. We called the authorities and they came immediately and the light was switched off. So now we\re looking carefully around for any other signals or marks. Everybody is alert. We\re changing shifts every two hours said Novak. Last week Russian naval artillery shelled the area with some missiles landing just off the beach and several others hitting residential homes but causing no casualties. Image caption Ukrainian media has broadcast numerous videos showing police arresting alleged Russian saboteurs Hanna Shelest a prominent analyst in Odesa who advises the Ukrainian parliament on security issues backed up concerns that Ukrainians or Russians were providing information to the Russian military. The first aim is the storage of weapons and ammunition in town in case street fighting starts here she explained. The second is to spread disinformation and gossip. The third aim is to mark directions in the city with signs for which way to go in case there is an amphibious landing by the Russians. And the fourth is to mark targets - either visually or with electronic signals - for artillery or airstrikes. Ukrainian media has broadcast numerous videos showing police arresting alleged Russian saboteurs. President Volodymyr Zelensky was also shown handing out medals to a group of police security agents credited with apprehending suspected Russian saboteurs and reconnaissance groups. But it is worth noting that for all the fear and suspicion aroused by such reports the evidence so far suggests that a few isolated Russian cells have so far been remarkably unsuccessful and that Ukrainian public opinion - directly contradicting Russian propaganda - has hardened and united against the Kremlins invasion. The idea that partisans or fifth columnists might be activated effectively in Ukraine would appear to have been entirely fanciful. Ukraine\s security services are definitely monitoring those under suspicion. And we already know some people have been arrested. But as for anything more serious - it is probably not their time yet said Dr Shelest.

Ukraine crisis: Why India is buying more Russian oil,"Imports of cheaper Russian oil by India are rising, despite calls for Russia's economic isolation.",Ukraine crisis: Why India is buying more Russian oil By Shruti Menon BBC Reality Check Published 5 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Rising global oil prices are a concern for Indias policymakers Russia is seeking new markets for its oil exports as Western sanctions tighten - and India has been taking advantage of discounted prices to ramp up imports from the country. The US has said that although these oil imports do not violate sanctions support for Russia...is support for an invasion that obviously is having a devastating impact. Where does India get its oil? After the US and China India is the worlds third-largest consumer of oil over 80% of which is imported. In 2021 India bought about 12 million barrels of oil from Russia only 2% of its total imports. By far the largest supplies last year came from the Middle East with significant quantities also from the US and Nigeria. In January and February India didnt import any oil from Russia. But contracts for March and April have already reached six million barrels according to data compiled by Kpler a commodities research group. The Indian government says even if it buys more oil from Russia it would still be a drop literally a drop in a larger bucket of its oil imports globally. Whats the deal India is getting? Following its invasion of Ukraine there are now fewer buyers for Russias Ural crude oil and its price has fallen. While we don\t know the exact price that India is paying the Urals discount to Brent crude the global benchmark] in the last week has widened to about $30 per barrel says Matt Smith an analyst at Kpler. These two types of crude normally sell at a similar price. But at one point in March as the price of Urals continued to drop the difference between them reached an all-time record he adds. So India and China are likely to purchase at least some of this Russian] crude at a significant discount he says. Can the world manage without Russian oil and gas? IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption India imports more than 80% of its oil Whats the impact of financial sanctions? Indias big refining companies are facing a challenge trying to finance these discounted purchases because of sanctions on Russian banks. Its a problem facing trade in both directions. Financial analysts Bloomberg estimate that Indian exporters to Russia are currently awaiting payments equivalent to about $500m (£381.5m). One of the options India is looking at is a transaction system based on local currencies where Indian exporters to Russia get paid in roubles instead of dollars or euros. Where else is India looking to buy oil? Indias oil imports from the US have gone up significantly since February according to analysts at Refinitiv. However market analysts say this may not be sustainable in the future as the US seeks to use its domestic oil production to replace supplies from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. There are also suggestions that trade with Iran could resume under a barter mechanism which Indian oil refiners could use to buy its oil. This arrangement stopped three years ago when the US reimposed sanctions on Iran. But this is unlikely to resume without a wider deal reached in international negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme.

Music is life. When music is silenced anything can happen. Music is a way of protecting our minds said Olexandr Proletarskyi a music critic sitting on a bar stool in a dark cellar venue near the city centre. But the recent reopening of clubs beach restaurants and nail salons across Odesa is not simply an expression of defiance or an economic necessity. It also reflects growing local confidence in the course of the war against Russia at least here on the Black Sea coast. The city is coming alive I feel. I think the fear is going away a bit. People believe in our army which is protecting us and feel comfortable feel safe. I don\t think the Russian army is winning said Alexander Hodosevich a drummer for an instrumental psychedelic band sitting with a group of friends after finishing an hour-long set at the More Music club. The venue has just reopened staging live (and live-streamed) concerts in the late afternoons to give audiences enough time to get home before curfew. IMAGE SOURCE BBC NEWS Image caption Bars restaurants and clubs are re-opening in Odesa North of the city on windswept beach popular with summer tourists razor wire land mines and sandbags now block all access to the sea. I\ve seen Russian ships. But they pulled back. They know we\re a threat to them. We\ve had a lot of incoming fire. From rockets over there. There have also been drones dropping bombs. But they won\t succeed here. Let them try to land - we\ll make them pay a heavy price said Anatolii 27 a Ukrainian soldier manning an anti-aircraft gun. There is a logic to Odesas growing confidence. Russias advance along the Black Sea coast has stalled. Ukrainian troops in the city of Mykolaiv have not only protected their strategic bridge but are now reported to be pushing Russian forces back to the east. In Kherson the first city to be seized by Russian troops a month ago occupying security forces are now being accused of using excessive force against civilian protesters and of abducting or arresting local leaders to try to contain popular unrest. When they started using this gas smoke pellets and stun grenades I started running. That was really scary said Lada Danik a university lecturer in Kherson speaking on a Skype call. The Russians] started kidnapping people going to their apartments and the places people live - protesters and activists. It seems they\re using more threatening techniques and tactics. I think they\re in panic she said. In Odesa there is enormous gratitude for the way Ukrainian soldiers in places like Mykolaiv and Voznesensk have stood their ground and blocked Russian land forces from moving further west. But what about an amphibious landing? The small town which blocked Russias big plans The security analyst Hanna Shelest believes that Odesa could have fallen to Russia if pro-Moscow leaders had engineered a surrender in the opening days of the war. But that option is now closed and she believes Russian troops would struggle to attack from the sea without first establishing a base on land. It seems to me that it\s just impossible. If you look at the technical conditions the strategic terrain Odesa has never been a city for easy taking (from the sea). History has proved it several times she said. In the meantime the citys vast catacombs - perhaps 2500km (1553 miles) of underground tunnels dug over the course of the past two centuries - are being prepared once again as possible air raid shelters. IMAGE SOURCE BBC NEWS Image caption The catacombs were used by fleeing families during both World Wars Mattresses and food supplies now sit in dark corners in the musty labyrinth-like network which was used by fleeing families and by partisans in both world wars as well as Russias Civil War. There\s graffiti here from the 1940s. This one says \Death to Fascists\ said caver and local historian Maxim Baranestski 46 waving his flashlight at lettering on a sand-coloured stone wall deep underground. But the firm hope in Odesa is that history will not repeat itself and that Russias push west along the coast will remain thwarted. Are you in Ukraine? Do you have relatives or friends who are there?

Zelensky says Ukraine prepared to discuss neutrality in peace talks,Ukraine's president says his country is open to adopting a neutral status as part of a possible peace deal.,Zelensky says Ukraine prepared to discuss neutrality in peace talks Published 5 days ago Share IMAGE SOURCE EPA Ukraines president has said his government is prepared to discuss adopting a neutral status as part of a peace deal with Russia. In an interview with independent Russian journalists Volodymyr Zelensky said any such deal would have to be put to a referendum in Ukraine. He has made similar comments before but rarely so forcefully. The news comes as the negotiations between the two countries are set to resume this week in Turkey. Security guarantees and neutrality non-nuclear status of our state. We are ready to go for it. This is the most important point Mr Zelensky said in the 90-minute video call. Neutrality means a country does not ally itself militarily with others. Mr Zelensky said that any potential agreement would require a face-to-face meeting with President Putin and that effective security guarantees that Ukraine would not come under attack were essential. The Ukrainian leader - speaking in Russian throughout - added that Russias invasion has caused the destruction of Russian-speaking cities in Ukraine. Later in an overnight video address to his nation Mr Zelensky said Ukraine sought peace without delay. Russias President Vladimir Putin has long demanded a neutral Ukraine and guarantees that it would not join the Nato military alliance. After the country achieved independence in 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed it has gradually veered towards the West - to both the EU and Nato. But Russia\s leader aims to reverse that seeing the fall of the Soviet Union as the disintegration of historical Russia. He has claimed Russians and Ukrainians are one people and denied Ukraine its long history. On Sunday the Russian state media regulator Roskomnadzor instructed the press not to publish the interview with Ukraine\s leader and said an investigation has been started in order to identify the level of responsibility and what response will be taken in relation to those who carried out the interview. Roskomnadzor notes some of the media outlets that conducted the interview are designated foreign agents in Russia. The country recently passed new laws restricting the way in which Russian media can report on the war in Ukraine. The interview was published by outlets now based outside Russia. Ukraines military intelligence chief has accused Moscow of seeking to split Ukraine in two mirroring North and South Korea after Russia failed to take control of the whole country. But a senior adviser to President Zelensky Alexander Rodnyansky told the BBC that Ukraine would make no concessions on handing over territory to Russia. We\re certainly not willing to give up any territory or talk about our territorial integrity Mr Rodnyansky told BBC Radio 4\s World at One programme. If you ask the people who live in these areas they wouldn\t want to live in Russia. How can we leave them? Let alone the whole idea of slicing up our country. The possibility of Ukrainian neutrality is not new. Its been discussed by Russian and Ukrainian officials for at least two weeks. But President Zelenskys reference is perhaps the most explicit so far. Clearly theres no room for Nato membership in such a vision of Ukraines future. Removing that aspiration from Ukraines constitution (it was added in 2019) will need to be put to a referendum. With support for membership at an all-time high it will be a bitter pill for many Ukrainians to swallow. The key will be what sort of security guarantees can possibly take the place of being a member of the Western alliance. Ukrainian officials insist that guarantees will need to be much more specific than the 1994 Budapest Memorandum which gave Ukraine security assurances in return for giving up its stock of nuclear weapons. Ukraine will want to know the precise terms under which countries are prepared to come to its defence in the event of further Russian aggression. There are many versions of neutrality. Finding one that meets the competing needs of Kyiv and Moscow will not be simple. And what will Ukraines borders actually be? President Zelensky says Russian troops must retreat to positions held before Moscows full-scale invasion began on 24 February. He says Ukraine will not try and retake the Donbas or Crimea by force but Ukrainian officials are not yet ready simply to give up on territories that have been under Russian control (direct or indirect) since 2014.

Bill Sharpe 49 has been collecting donations at his family-run business in Radcliffe-on-Trent Nottinghamshire. Mr Sharpe and Ed will drive the ambulance from the UK to the countrys border with Poland on Friday. They will then hand it over to a local contact to take the much-needed transport and aid into Ukraine. Mr Sharpes company funded the purchase of the old ambulance that he and his 27-year-old son will take turns in driving across Europe. He said former NHS vehicles were usually decommissioned before being sold meaning the equipment and the emergency lights would have been removed. However he said he was able to organise for it to be kept in its original condition due to the nature of where it was going. He said: The main reason for doing this was getting ambulances over there for the soldiers. The contact that we\ve got over there in Ukraine said they were a desperate requirement. So we\re getting them over but filled with aid as well. IMAGE SOURCE BILL SHARPE Image caption Mr Sharpe has filled the ambulance with donated supplies They have been collecting donations of medical equipment womens sanitary products nappies and ready-made baby milk. Mr Sharpe was also hoping to take a defibrillator if he can get one. That\s the kind of \holy grail\ thing that we\d love to be able to get hold of he said. Despite heading towards a war zone Mr Sharpe said he did not have any safety concerns. I\m worried mentally about what it\s going to be like at the other end. It\s obviously not a very nice environment with a lot of displaced unhappy people so I\m a bit apprehensive about that he said. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook Twitter or Instagram.

Ukraine war: Russian officials seize Swiss watches apparently worth millions,"Agents raided a Moscow premises of luxury brand Audemars Piguet, according to a report in Swiss media.",Ukraine war: Russian officials seize Swiss watches apparently worth millions Published 5 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Jewel-encrusted Audemars Piguet watches on display in London this month Russian officials have reportedly confiscated millions of dollars worth of luxury Audemars Piguet watches. The Swiss timepieces were seized from a shop by security service agents on Tuesday for allegedly violating customs rules Swiss media report. It happened just days after Switzerland abandoned its traditional neutrality to join Western countries in imposing sanctions against Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. There is no Swiss confirmation. However the government has said Switzerland\s new luxury export ban has been causing uncertainties for some businesses. Watches from Audemars Piguet can cost more than £700000 ($921000) a piece. The company has not responded to a BBC request for comment. Russia hits back at sanctions with export bans Putin alters law on leased jets to defy sanctions According to Switzerlands NZZ am Sontag newspaper the watches were seized by agents working for Russias FSB security service from a Moscow subsidiary of Audemars Piguet. The agents apparently justified their raid by claiming the watches in question had violated local customs rules when they were being imported to Russia. After the invasion the luxury Swiss brand said it had ceased its operations in Russia and its website describes both of its two boutiques in the capital as temporarily closed. According to industry officials Switzerland exported 260 million Swiss francs ($280m) worth of watches to Russia last year but the market may be worth even more to the Swiss watch sector given the number of Russian customers buying luxury products in Switzerland. Russian officials have shown an increased willingness in the last few weeks to seize property from foreign companies trying to reduce their business dealings in Russia. Hundreds of leased foreign passenger jets worth almost $10bn remain grounded in the country with their owners having had their requests to return the airplanes denied. Earlier this month former President Dmitry Medvedev said that a new law would allow Russia to nationalise the assets of Western companies pulling out of the country.

People gathered in Bath at the weekend to raise funds for charities supporting those caught up in the war in Ukraine. Some said they were fearful people were dying while waiting to get visas enabling them to seek refuge in the UK. The Home Office said it was doing everything possible to ensure a rapid service. IMAGE SOURCE ZHENYA SHKIL Image caption Ms Shkils cousin Olesksandr now has a visa that will allow him to stay in Bath Zhenya Shkil who lives near Bath said getting a visa for her 12-year-old cousin was complex. I have family in East Ukraine in quite a dangerous location near the power station she said. Luckily thankfully we got visas for Olesksandr to come and stay with us here. The application form is really complex and confusing she added. There is a mixture of questions about sponsors and applicants and everyone makes mistakes. There\s no way you can deal with it. It takes about an hour to fill in one form with me on the phone with someone talking me through. Image caption A small number of people gathered for the demonstration Jura Everauskite who also attended the demonstration on Saturday said she did not want the public to forget that war is happening. The visas scheme in the UK is just unacceptable. People have to wait weeks for their visas while people are dying she said. We want to protest that. It doesn\t make sense.

War in Ukraine: The danger of wishful Western thinking,"With Russia still a powerful force, wide-eyed realism is what Ukraine needs from the US and Europe.",War in Ukraine: The danger of wishful Western thinking By Katty Kay US special correspondent Published 25 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption A man walks away from a building hit by Russian fire in Kharkiv on 25 March In the second episode of Volodymyr Zelensky\s very funny comedy series The Servant of the People one of the spooky bad guys says of Zelensky\s character the newly elected President of Ukraine: He\s known for being iron clad and brave. That was the point I reached for the remote pressed pause and took a deep breath. The 2015 series has just starting airing here in America and for those of us who are new to it its a bit surreal. Every time you catch yourself chuckling you then start to feel sad. Its emotionally draining. I find I cant watch more than an episode at a time and I do so with a certain dread. Friends have told me they cant watch it at all. And its not because its bad. Its a good show and Zelensky is a talented actor. Hes charming and self-deprecating. No its hard to watch because we fear whats going to happen to the real President of Ukraine. There\s another scene in that same episode where the new president Vasyl Petrovych Holoborodko is introduced to his security detail body double. A smarmy political flunky turns from the double to Zelensky and says He\ll die from a sniper bullet for you then he laughs out loud at Zelensky\s look of horror. But the flunky chortles I think it won\t come to that. And then your stomach turns because right now it feels like the whole Western world is watching Ukraine and just praying that it wont indeed come to that. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visiting wounded Ukrainian troops on 13 March No-one would wish any of this suffering on Ukraine. But for the moment Zelensky and the brave people he leads are heroes in a world that has been short of them. Weve come out of a dark period of ugly political division and tragic medical crisis and we are longing for something good to believe in. Forty four million brave Ukrainians seem to have risen to the challenge and given us cause for hope in the power of the underdog. We root for them. We are amazed by their resilience. We long for them to survive and stay free. So its understandable that we may fall victim to what one analyst eloquently described as Western wishful thinking.

READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis After the invasion one US senator told me confidently that whatever happened the Ukrainian people would be free. It was the optimism Ive come to expect and appreciate from US politicians. And we hope it will be true. History reminds us however that good doesnt always prevail. Not against Russia anyway. Ask the Syrians still stuck under the boot of the Assad regime their cities destroyed by Russian bombs. Ask the Chechens who saw their capital flattened on the orders of Vladimir Putin. Or ask the countless brave Arabs Iranians Belarusians and Myanmarese who risked their lives to protest against oppressive rulers with little to show for it. In the suburbs of Ukraine that have become Putins latest battlefield David has indeed given Goliath an almighty shock. But make no mistake Russia is still a daunting adversary. One senior European diplomat who understands Putin is convinced that the Russian president has no interest in negotiating any settlement. Rather he thinks Putin is using this moment to regroup and resupply ready for another potentially more devastating assault. Were hopeful Westerners at risk of underestimating Russias military chances I asked? Yes he nodded. Image caption Ukraine campaign map on 24 March Russias military boasts 900000 active duty troops and two million reservists - more than eight times that of Ukraine. It still has a massive arsenal and a satellite state in Belarus from which it can draw more troops as well as the ability to recruit mercenaries from countries like Georgia or Syria. It has cyber warfare capabilities it has not yet fully unleashed. It has 4500 nuclear weapons it has threatened to use and chemical weapons that the West has warned it might. The Russians have performed much worse than anyone expected but they have made some territorial gains making slow but steady progress around Mariupol and threatening to cut off Ukrainian forces near the breakaway eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Often this progress has come by flattening civilian neighbourhoods. Ignoring or diminishing those gains or the remaining power of the Russian military wont help Ukraine. Indeed it could hurt it. The Ukrainians success depends on two things their own phenomenal courage and just as critical the steady supply of military hardware that its getting from Western countries. If those countries or the public in those countries start for a moment to think David has beaten Goliath then the flow of weapons could slow or stop. That would be catastrophic for the Ukrainian resistance. President Biden has spent this week in Europe shoring up the Western alliance. But theres a growing recognition this fight will go on for longer than either Russia or the West anticipated. The Ukrainians may need arms supplies for months to come. The alliance will need to keep its resolve in order to match Putins determination. This is no time to be unrealistic. Wide-eyed realism will help Zelensky more than wishful thinking.]
War in Ukraine: Change of emphasis or admission of failure by Moscow?,"Moscow now says the main aim is to ""liberate"" eastern Ukraine - a change of emphasis or more?",War in Ukraine: Change of emphasis or admission of failure by Moscow? By Paul Adams BBC News Published 25 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Kharkiv has been pounded for weeks - now that Russian firepower may be deployed further east Is the Russian military having to change its plans? Perhaps even reduce the scale of Moscows ambitions in Ukraine? Its probably too early to tell but theres definitely a shift in emphasis. A top Russian general - Sergey Rudskoy - says the first stage of what President Vladimir Putin calls Russia\s special military operation has been mostly accomplished and that Russian forces will now concentrate on the complete liberation of the Donbas. This is likely to mean a more concerted effort to push beyond the line of contact that separates Ukrainian government-held territory in the east of the country from the Russian-backed separatist people\s republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. The pace of Russias advance in other areas of Ukraine remains glacial. Its forces have been pushed back from positions around the capital Kyiv and are said to have started digging defensive positions to avoid losing more or prepare for some kind of pause. Next stop Kyiv - the battle on the capitals outskirts Defiant troops tell Russians: Go home while youre still alive Its probably way too early to conclude that Russia has given up on capturing Kyiv but Western officials say that Russia continues to experience setback after setback. On Friday they said Russia had lost another general - the seventh - and that morale was at rock bottom in some units. They believe General Rudskoys announcement implies that Moscow knows that its ambitious pre-war strategy has failed. Russia is recognising that it can\t pursue its operations on multiple axes simultaneously one official said. As many as 10 new Russian battalion tactical groups are being generated officials say and are heading for the Donbas. Even before the war began last month they voiced the fear that Russia would make a concerted effort to encircle and envelop Ukraines best fighting units which make up the Joint Forces Operation (JFO) stationed along the line of contact. Retreat may not mean tame ambitions A renewed push now could see Russian troops pushing out into so-far unconquered areas of Donetsk and Luhansk possibly aiming to link up with forces moving south from Kharkiv and Izyum. And if Russia can succeed in finally pacifying the port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov then other forces could move north and complete the encirclement of the JFO. Some of these objectives still seem out of reach. Mariupols defenders are putting up a ferocious fight preventing Russia from fully achieving another of its pre-war ambitions - a land bridge from the Crimean Peninsula to the Donbas. But if Moscow has concluded that it makes more sense to concentrate for the time being on achieving one objective at a time its likely to concentrate its firepower especially from the air. The Ukrainian military disciplined and motivated as it is will need all the help it can get to withstand the pressure. I hope that\s where the Western supply of arms will make a significant contribution to Ukrainian forces one Western official said. If the coming days do see a shift of focus to the Donbas that doesnt yet mean that Moscow has abandoned its wider ambitions. We don\t see a re-evaluation of the invasion as a whole a senior US defence official said.

Ukraine: UK lawyer appointed to probe war crime claims,"The former International Criminal Court judge will advise Ukraine's prosecutor, attorney general says.",Ukraine: UK lawyer appointed to probe war crime claims By Harriet Agerholm BBC News Published 6 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin has been accused of violating international law including targeting civilians The UKs attorney general has appointed a war crimes lawyer to advise Ukraine over the Russian invasion. Suella Braverman said Sir Howard Morrison would become an independent adviser to Ukraines chief prosecutor Iryna Venediktova. Sir Howard served as a judge on the International Criminal Court in The Hague for more than 12 years. It comes as Russian forces continue to be accused of violating international law by targeting civilians. Could Putin be prosecuted for war crimes? Are Russias attacks war crimes? Earlier this month Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of committing war crimes after it launched air strikes in Kharkiv that hit an opera house a concert hall and government offices. The ICCs chief prosecutor later said evidence was being collected on whether the Russian military had committed war crimes crimes against humanity and genocide. But Russia is not a member of the ICC so any Russian nationals indicted by the court would have to be extradited by the Kremlin. Asked by MPs in the House of Commons on Thursday about alternative ways of prosecuting war criminals other than the ICC the attorney general said all options are on the table although she insisted the ICC was the UK\s preferred option. I will always defer and support my counterpart in Ukraine the prosecutor general in terms of my efforts to support her in terms of her choice of route for redress she said. But whilst we welcome the focus on accountability we do believe that the ICC is the right place for those responsible for committing these atrocious crimes in Ukraine to be held accountable for their actions. Announcing Sir Howard\s appointment Ms Braverman said the UK was committed to showing that the atrocities we see being committed day after day in Ukraine will not be forgotten. Ms Venediktova welcomed Sir Howard\s help saying his experience and knowledge of international criminal law speaks louder than words. During his time as a judge Sir Howard oversaw cases such as that of the Serbian war criminal Radovan Karadzic. The attorney generals office said Ms Braverman was in regular communication with Ukraines prosecutor general and they planned to meet in person next month. On a trip to The Hague last week Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab accused Mr Putin of responding in ever more barbaric ways in Ukraine and offered the ICC financial and technical help for prosecuting alleged war crimes in the country. Boris Johnson has used similar language describing the Russian military under Mr Putin\s orders of using barbaric and indiscriminate tactics. Russia denies targeting civilians and says it is carrying out a military operation against neo-Nazis in Ukraine.

War in Ukraine: Anti-war Russians intimidated on their doorsteps,The doors of Russian journalists and activists who speak out against the war are being vandalised.,War in Ukraine: Anti-war Russians intimidated on their doorsteps By Ben Tobias BBC News Published 6 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE DARYA KHEIKINEN Image caption Darya Kheikinens apartment door was vandalised two nights in a row. Russian activists and journalists speaking out against their country\s so-called special military operation in Ukraine have had their homes vandalised by unknown pro-Kremlin figures. Apartment doors have been daubed with threatening graffiti labelling the people inside a traitor with messages featuring the letter Z - a pro-Kremlin symbol of Russia\s war in Ukraine. Other examples are even more extreme. In one case a leading Russian journalist discovered a pigs head wearing a wig on his doorstep with an anti-Semitic sticker stuck to his door. Alexei Venediktov the long-time editor of radio station Ekho of Moscow before it stopped broadcasting due to increased Russian censorship posted photos of the vandalism pointing out the irony of an anti-Semitic attack happening in the country that defeated fascism. Such vandalism is a sign of the increasingly intimidating atmosphere in Russia for those people who publicly express their opposition to the war in Ukraine. Manure on the doorstep When Darya Kheikinen looked through the peephole on the door of her St Petersburg apartment she noticed it had been painted red on the outside. She guessed straight away what had happened - there had been similar instances with other activists. She opened the door to find the word traitor scrawled in large red letters across the outside several pieces of paper with messages such as a traitor to the motherland lives here pinned to her home and a pile of manure on the mat at her feet. IMAGE SOURCE DARYA KHEIKINEN Image caption Darya Kheikinen found a pile of manure on her doorstep two days in a row It probably happened because of my public anti-war statements and opposition views Ms Kheikinen a well-known political activist told the BBC adding that the same thing happened to three other St Petersburg activists at the same time. It happened again the next morning - but only to her this time. The door was covered in green dye and there was spray foam in the lock. There were signs reading \we will not forgive Nazism\ and \a Finnish Nazi lives here\ she said pointing out that her surname is Finnish. The messages reflect the Kremlin\s false claims that Ukraine\s government is run by Nazis and its operation in Ukraine is necessary to denazify the country. Ms Kheikinen doesnt know who was responsible for the attack but said as far as she knows the only people who have her address are her parents and the police. I can\t say that it has scared me she said. Actually I find it amusing. Imagine some idiot dragging a bag of manure up the stairs to the 11th floor - and doing it two nights in a row! Scum and traitors Since Russia\s war in Ukraine began life for those who oppose it has become increasingly difficult. The government passed a law threatening people who spread fake information about the war with 15 years in prison. Vladimir Putin and other politicians have painted any opposition to the war as a betrayal of the country. Any people and especially the Russian people will always be able to distinguish the true patriots from the scum and the traitors and just spit them out like a fly that accidentally flew into their mouth the president said in a speech on 16 March. He went on to claim that the West is trying to destroy Russia by using fifth columnists - meaning enemies within - to provoke civil confrontation. IMAGE SOURCE DMITRY IVANOV Image caption Don\t betray the motherland Dima warns a message on Dmitry Ivanov\s door Just a few hours after that speech student activist Dmitry Ivanov whose anti-war opinions are a major feature of his Telegram channel with nearly 10000 followers received a call from his mother asking if he had seen the graffiti all over the door to their landing. It said \don\t betray the motherland Dima\ he told the BBC. There were also three large Zs making it clear the message related to Russia\s actions in Ukraine. The neighbours probably weren\t that surprised he said explaining that his political opinions are no secret because the police turn up at his door every now and then to warn him against attending protests. The doors of three other activists and journalists in Moscow were also vandalised that evening. But Mr Ivanov whose activism began by reporting on a protest against a noisy fan-zone directly outside his university during the 2018 football World Cup in Russia said the attack hasnt put him off. The actions of the police frighten me much more. They have the resources and power to ruin people\s lives but this - this is just minor hooliganism. He decided not to report the vandalism to the police because he didnt want to end up on the wrong side of them he said. Incidents like these might be minor but they are the product of a political environment where you either support the war or are labelled a traitor. The consequences for those who oppose Russias actions in Ukraine are wide-ranging and can include losing your job or even criminal prosecution. But Mr Ivanov says that despite the danger his opposition will continue. The threat of 15 years in jail worries me. But the war is much more scary. This completely destructive senseless cruelty carried out by our country in our name - it is just a huge shock. IMAGE SOURCE .

Army boss raises partition fears: Ukraine round-up,Ukraine's military intelligence chief fears a Korea-style outcome as Biden's jab at Putin makes further waves.,Army boss raises partition fears: Ukraine round-up Published 6 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Russian troops have so far failed to subdue the whole of Ukraine Ukraine\s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov has warned that Russia is trying to apply what he called the Korean scenario to Ukraine having failed to take the capital and depose the legitimate government. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin would try to impose a demarcation line separating the eastern and southern regions from the rest of Ukraine since he would not be able to absorb the whole country. Gen Budanov predicted this quasi-state would be unviable given the resistance of the local population. He said that what he described as a total Ukrainian guerrilla safari was about to open. The generals warning came amid continued reaction to US President Joe Bidens speech in Poland on Saturday in which he said that Mr Putin should not be allowed to remain in power. Media caption Joe Bidens speech on Saturday has had continuing repercussions Mr Bidens Secretary of State Antony Blinken denied that the US had any plans to bring about regime change in Russia or anywhere else. And French President Emmanuel Macron warned against the verbal escalation of the war in Ukraine saying this would make it impossible to bring about a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops. But this isnt the first time President Biden has veered off-script and thrown a live grenade into an otherwise well-prepared measured speech. Is that a strength - saying what many of his citizens are thinking - or a weakness? Our North America reporter Anthony Zurcher takes a look at President Bidens habit of going off-book. Claims of forced deportation IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption Dozens of refugees are now housed in a sports centre in Taganrog Russia east of Mariupol All of us were taken forcibly a refugee from Ukraine\s besieged city of Mariupol says - from Russia where they now are. Ukraine accuses Russia of forcibly deporting its people from war-ravaged cities to Russian-held territory or all the way to Russia proper. Satellite images show a temporary camp east of Mariupol that is housing an estimated 5000 people. Forcibly deporting civilians is seen as an international human rights abuse - but Russia denies it is doing anything of the sort. But what choice do people have when they are in danger or are warned of an incoming missile strike if they remain where they are? Laurence Peter looks at the stories of people who say soldiers have sent them into Russia. Ukraine rejects breakaway referendum plan Ukraine has described plans by the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peoples Republic to hold a referendum on joining Russia as having no legal basis. Ukraines foreign ministry spokesman said any referendum would be fake and warned that Moscow would face further isolation if it went ahead. Earlier the leader of Luhansk said a vote could happen soon and that the population would vote overwhelmingly to leave Ukraine and join Russia. He later rowed back on that statement Tass reports to clarify that he had only been stating a personal opinion - and that no preparations were actually being made for such a vote. Last month Russia formally recognised the Luhansk and Donetsk breakaway republics as independent states paving the way for Russian troops invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine: Medical students back in India left in the lurch,Students face an uncertain future as completing their medical degree remains a challenge.,Ukraine: Medical students back in India left in the lurch By Arunoday Mukharji BBC News Delhi Published 6 days ago Share IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption More than 18000 Indian students were studying medicine in Ukraine before the war began Sooraj Kumar is back with his family in Babuapur village in the central Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The 26-year-old was one of the more than 18000 Indian students studying medicine in Ukraine who were evacuated after the war began. Mr Kumar was in a medical school in Uzhhorod for the past six years and would have qualified as a doctor in three months. Mr Kumar now stares at an uncertain future - he is unable to continue his studies or find a place in Indian colleges. The dream of becoming a doctor for thousands of young Indians begins from small towns and villages. But aspirants have always far outnumbered the vacancies available at affordable government-run colleges. Private medical colleges are accessible to only those who can afford very high fees. In 2021 over 1.5 million students appeared for qualifying exams to government colleges but less than 6% managed to get admission. According to Public Health Foundation of India a think tank only one out of every 11 candidates in 2014 got into medical colleges. Last year the number had increased to one out of every 19 candidates. Dismal results So you have an increase in the number of people wanting to be admitted but the seats have not risen proportionately. As a result a large number of students look for outside avenues says president of the foundation K Srinath Reddy. A farmers son Mr Kumar was studying to be the first doctor not just in the family but in his entire village. Since he could not get admission in a government college heading to Ukraine was the next affordable option. I would have had to pay nearly $150000 (£113000) in a private Indian medical college but in Ukraine it cost me around $30000 for the entire six-year course. Still] I took a huge loan and my father had to sell some of our ancestral land to fund my studies] Mr Kumar said. For medical students with a foreign degree there is one final hurdle - clearing a qualifying exam to practice in India. The percentage of success in these exams have been fairly dismal says Dr Reddy. Between 2015 and 2018 the pass percentage was only 19%. In 2019 it went up to 25% but it came down to 16% in 2020. IMAGE SOURCE SWATI SAGARIKA SABAT Image caption Swati Sagarika Sabat has been attending online classes organised by her university on her phone He said the teaching system abroad didn\t adequately prepare students to Indian medical practices. Now as students return from Ukraine leaving their studies mid-way there is uncertainty. I worry without a degree I can\t take the qualifying examination in India. How do I even fill out my application if I don\t have a degree? Mr Kumar laments. Its a reality that 22-year old medical student Swati Sagarika Sabat is still coming to terms with. Shes back home in Kendrapara city in the eastern state of Odisha struggling to learn medicine over a Zoom class her university in Ukraine has organised. We are not sitting with our teachers or seeing patients. How can anyone learn how to perform a surgery online? We can\t learn without getting any practical experience says Ms Sabat. Shortage of doctors Some feel the government should allow the students from Ukraine to be accommodated in local medical colleges. The government has said it is looking into their matter. But what is essential is improving the existing infrastructure in India so that students have more choices in the country instead of having to go abroad. In the last seven years the number of medical seats in Indian colleges has gone up from around 52000 to nearly 89000. This is a substantial rise but still not enough. With one doctor for every 1500 people India desperately need more medical professionals The government is looking to set up hospitals in districts especially in rural areas. The upgraded district hospitals will have medical colleges attached to them. By using district hospitals as a training area you are actually also creating a cultural shift. You are making them much more responsive to the needs of the community says Dr Reddy. You may also be interested in: Media caption Watch: Indian students on the trauma of escaping Ukraines war]

Ukraine conflict: What is Nato and how has it responded to Russia's invasion?,Nato faces one of the biggest challenges in its history with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.,Ukraine conflict: What is Nato and how has it responded to Russias invasion? Published 25 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Leaders of the Nato military alliance have approved major increases of forces in Eastern Europe. They also said that any use of chemical or biological weapons by Russia would result in severe consequences. What is Nato? Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - is a military alliance formed in 1949 by 12 countries including the US Canada the UK and France. Its aim was originally to counter the threat of post-war Russian expansion in Europe. Soviet Russia responded by creating its own military alliance of eastern European communist countries called the Warsaw Pact. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 a number of former Warsaw Pact countries switched sides and joined Nato. The alliance now has 30 members. Members agree to come to one anothers aid in the event of an armed attack against any individual member state. Why isnt Nato sending troops to Ukraine? Because Ukraine isnt a Nato member the alliance isnt obliged to come to the countrys defence. And Nato countries fear that if their troops confront Russian forces in Ukraine it could lead to an all-out conflict between Russia and the West. Nato says its members are determined to do all we can to support Ukraine but must ensure the war doesn\t escalate beyond its borders. This is why Nato rejected imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine. However it has approved sending four new battlegroups to Slovakia Hungary Bulgaria and Romania - three of which border Ukraine - doubling Natos presence in the region. Western leaders meet to discuss Ukraine support UK troops will not fight against Russia - Wallace Why isnt Ukraine a Nato member? Nato offered Ukraine a path towards membership in 2008. After Russias annexation of Crimea in 2014 Ukraine made joining a priority. But this hasnt happened mainly because of Russias long-standing opposition. One of Russias demands before the invasion was that Ukraine should never be allowed to join - something the alliance refused to support. Russia fears Nato is encroaching on its territory by taking on new members from eastern Europe and that admitting Ukraine would bring its forces into its backyard. Ukraine\s President Zelensky has accepted his country can\t join Nato at present saying: It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of Nato. We understand this. China joins Russia in opposing Nato expansion Which weapons have the UK and other countries sent to Ukraine? Ahead of the Nato meeting in Brussels the UK said it would provide 6000 new defensive missiles and £25m to help Ukraine pay its armed forces. The UK has already supplied more than 4000 shoulder-mounted NLAW anti-tank missiles as well as a small number of Javelin missiles. It has also sent some Starstreak missiles. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption A Ukrainian soldier holding a Javelin anti-tank missile system during exercises in 2021 It has also given body armour helmets and boots. In addition the UK has deployed Sky Sabre a long-range air defence system to Poland along with 100 military personnel to operate it. The US initially sent $200m (£152m) and then a further $350m (£267m) of weapons. This included Javelin missiles Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and body armour. The US has since announced a $1bn (£760m) security aid package. This includes more sophisticated longer-range weapons and drones. It has also allowed other Nato countries to supply Ukraine with US-made weapons. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Nato has stepped up its military defences in eastern Europe The EU has said it will spend up to 450m euros (£376m) to fund the supply of weapons to Ukraine. It is the first time in its history that the EU has helped provide arms for a warzone. Germany too has dropped its long-standing restrictions on supplying weapons to a combat area. The Netherlands Belgium Poland Estonia Latvia the Czech Republic and Slovakia have also sent military equipment including ammunition fuel and rations. Are arms shipments to Ukraine making a difference? How many troops does Nato have in Eastern Europe? Even before the latest deployments are agreed Nato already had troops stretching from the Baltic republics in the north to Romania in the south. They were stationed there in 2014 after Russia\s annexation of Crimea and are designed to act as a tripwire in case of a Russian attack. Nato has sent elements of its 40000-strong Response Force to Eastern European countries bordering Russia and Ukraine. It has 100 fighter jets on high alert and 120 ships including three carrier groups patrolling the seas from the far north to the eastern Mediterranean. The US has committed to sending more troops to Europe - they will join the four multinational battlegroups Nato has in Estonia Latvia Lithuania and Poland and its multinational brigade in Romania.]

"Ukraine not alone in fight against Russia, says Boris Johnson","Boris Johnson warns if Vladimir Putin uses chemical weapons in Ukraine the consequences will be ""catastrophic for him"".",Ukraine not alone in fight against Russia says Boris Johnson Published 25 March comments Comments Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EPA Ukraine is not alone in its fight against Russia\s invasion Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He said the UK would not stand by while Vladimir Putin vents his fury on Ukraine and would work to ramp up defensive weaponry for the country. Speaking in Brussels he warned that if the Russian president used chemical weapons the consequences would be catastrophic for him. Earlier the UK announced sanctions on 65 more Russian groups and individuals. Mr Johnson later told BBC Newsnight that Russia did not want peace and instead wanted to intensify its attack on Ukraine. Leaders from Nato the EU and the G7 have been holding emergency meetings in Brussels to discuss the conflict. Speaking at a news conference following the Nato summit Mr Johnson defended the level of the UKs support for Ukraine saying the government planned to send 6000 more missiles to the country as well as an extra £25m in aid to help Ukraine pay the salaries of its armed forces. The PM said kit would be provided to Ukraine to defend against its bullying neighbour. Mr Johnson also promised a new deployment of UK troops to Bulgaria on top of doubling troops both in Poland and in Estonia. It follows Natos earlier announcement that new battle groups would be created in Bulgaria Hungary Romania and Slovakia. The message Putin can take is: Ukraine is not alone. We stand with the people of Kyiv Mariupol Lviv and Donetsk Mr Johnson said. As President Zelensky himself has said the people of Ukraine must prevail and Putin must fail - and he will. Lets hit Putins gold says PM amid new sanctions Defiant troops to Russians: Go home while youre alive Western leaders meet to discuss Ukraine support Mr Johnson added that Western nations were looking to steadily ratchet up the amount of military gear they are sending Ukraine but that it was proving difficult to meet the country\s request for warplanes and tanks. In a virtual appearance at the summit earlier Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\s asked Nato for 1% of all your planes 1% of all your tanks. Mr Johnson said: What President Zelensky wants is to try to relieve Mariupol and to help the thousands of Ukrainian fighters in the city. To that end he does need armour as he sees it. We are looking at what we can do to help. But logistically it looks very difficult both with armour and with jets. Mr Johnson added that no Western power was looking to put boots on the ground or impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. He acknowledged that the Ukrainian president wanted more from Nato saying allies felt agony about their inability to do more given the constraints we face. In a statement reported by Russias Ria news agency Russias foreign ministry said Natos decision to continue supporting Ukraine showed the military alliance wanted the conflict to continue. Media caption Watch: Zelensky calls on people to support freedom one month after Russia invaded Ukraine The UK government has already given £400m in humanitarian and economic aid to Ukraine and its neighbouring nations since Russias invasion last month. The PM said ministers had sanctioned more than 1000 Russian individuals and entities so far in the toughest sanctions the UK had ever imposed. The Wagner Group a private military firm thought to function as an arms-length unit of the Russian military was among the 65 entities hit by the latest sanctions announced by the UK earlier. Also targeted were Gazprombank the countrys third-largest bank and one of the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas and the state-run shipping firm Sovcomflot. The stepdaughter of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov Polina Kovaleva who is thought to own a London property worth an estimated £4m was also targeted by the measures. Earlier Mr Johnson called on the West to consider measures to prevent Russia using its gold reserves to prop up its currency the rouble. He told the news conference the Kremlin was trying to get around the sanctions on their gold and the UK and others were trying to ensure there was no leakage or no sale of bullion into markets around the world. War in Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby WATCH: Destruction of Ukraines cities from above ZELENSKY: How Ukraines leader tailors his addresses READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis The prime minister said he was not remotely anti-Russian after the Kremlin labelled him the most active participant in the race to be anti-Russian. He said that while one could be sympathetic to ordinary Russians the way Mr Putin was leading Russia was utterly catastrophic and his invasion of Ukraine was inhuman and barbaric. Mr Johnson dismissed talk about the use of nuclear weapons as a distraction from what was happening in Ukraine - where he said Russia\s use of conventional weapons against innocent people had been absolutely barbaric. He warned that any use of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine by Russia would be disastrous for Putin. There is a visceral horror of the use of these weapons of mass destruction. I think that if Putin were to engage in anything like that the consequences would be very very severe. You have to have a bit of ambiguity about your response but I think it would be catastrophic for him if he were to do that. And I think that he understands that. Media caption Watch what Boris Johnson says about the prospect of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine In an interview with the BBCs Newsnight Mr Johnson said Ukraine can win the war with Russia - not necessarily on the battlefield but by making an occupation impossible. There\s a sense in which Putin has already failed or lost because I think that he had literally no idea that the Ukrainians were going to mount the resistance that they are and he totally misunderstood what Ukraine is - and far from extinguishing Ukraine as a nation he\s solidified it... He can\t subjugate Ukraine. The prime minister added that he was not optimistic the Russian president truly wanted peace and that he had instead decided to double down in his assault on Ukraine which he said was a tragic mistake. Mr Johnson sparked anger at the weekend after appearing to make a comparison between Britons voting to leave the European Union and Ukrainians fighting for the freedom from Russia. But when asked about this the prime minister said that had not been the analogy he was making and his words had been wildly misconstrued. Elsewhere US President Joe Biden warned any use of chemical weapons by Mr Putin would be met with a response in kind the nature of which would depend on the nature of the use. Mr Biden said the Russian President had miscalculated in his decision to invade Ukraine and had banked on Nato being split. Nato has never never been more united. Putin is getting exactly the opposite of (what) he intended to have as a consequence of going into Ukraine.

Steve Bullock 61 from Middlesbrough last saw his wife Lyuda when he left her in eastern Ukraine on 18 February. He had planned to return weeks later but then Russia invaded. He said his wife 53 is staying in her home town of Zasullya where she continues to teach English in between making camouflage netting to cover vehicles wanting to drive out. The couple met online five years ago and got married in September 2020. Neither has been able to stay too long in each others home countries due to visa requirements and plans for a permanent visa application for his wife were delayed due to her work. Mr Bullock said none of the couples friends and family in Ukraine thought Russia would invade the country and he had his return to Ukraine booked for March. If the war had started when I was there there is no way I would have left he said. IMAGE SOURCE STEVE BULLOCK Image caption Steve Bollcuk said he would have stayed in Ukraine with his wife if he knew war was coming He said his wife\s online lessons were frequently interrupted by air raid sirens and rocket fire can heard at night although her village remains relatively safe. Mr Bullock has sent money for things like petrol pharmacy supplies and baby milk but said he quickly came to realise thousands of pounds were going to be needed to support people. An online donation page has already brought in 90% of the £2000 he initially set out to raise. He said the generosity of people in the UK who are sending supplies to the Ukrainian border is tremendous. Mr Bullock said he video calls his wife up to four times a day but it\s hard to see what she and her fellow Ukrainians are going through. Sometimes she wants to get out and other times she says \everything will be okay don\t worry\ Mr Bullock said. He said: If she said \get me out of here\ I would drive to the Ukrainian border wherever she was at the drop of a hat. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter Facebook and Instagram.

"Ukraine: No Russia regime change plans, says Blinken",The US secretary of state spoke after President Biden said Vladimir Putin should not remain in power.,Ukraine: No Russia regime change plans says Blinken Published 7 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Antony Blinken said it was up to the Russian people to choose their leader US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has denied that the United States has any plans to bring about regime change in Russia or anywhere else. Mr Blinkens comments come a day after President Joe Biden said his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin should not be allowed to remain in power. Mr Biden made the unscripted remark at the end of a speech in Poland. Mr Blinken said the president simply made the point that Mr Putin could not be allowed to wage war against Ukraine. The Kremlin dismissed Mr Bidens remark saying it was for Russians to choose their leader. I think the president the White House made the point last night that quite simply President Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else Mr Blinken said on Sunday during a visit to Israel. As you know and as you have heard us say repeatedly we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia or anywhere else for that matter. In this case as in any case it\s up to the people of the country in question it\s up to the Russian people he added. Media caption Watch: Joe Biden closes speech in Poland by saying Vladimir Putin cannot remain in power For God\s sake this man cannot remain in power US President Joe Biden said about his Russian counterpart President Vladimir Putin during a speech in Poland\s capital Warsaw on Saturday. This was quickly followed by the White House saying Mr Biden wasnt calling for regime change but was instead making a point about Mr Putin not being allowed to exercise power over his neighbours. This was clearly an attempt at rolling back - the concern is that this is going to put more pressure on Putin and make him more uneasy. Given that he is the head of a country that is struggling militarily and is in control of a nuclear arsenal the concern on the Americans part is that they dont want to back Mr Putin into a corner. Calling out for regime change directly could cause instability and increase unpredictability. And the last thing you want in these circumstances is unpredictability. Mr Bidens comment prompted strong criticism from veteran US diplomat Richard Haass. The comments made a difficult situation more difficult and a dangerous situation more dangerous tweeted Mr Haass who is president of the US Council on Foreign Relations. That is obvious he added. Less obvious is how to undo the damage but I suggest his chief aides reach their counterparts & make clear the US is prepared to deal with this Russian government. Mr Haass returned to the subject after the White House qualified President Biden\s remarks saying: The White House walk back of @POTUS regime change call is unlikely to wash. Putin will see it as confirmation of what he\s believed all along. Bad lapse in discipline that runs risk of extending the scope and duration of the war.

Ukraine: India 'feeling the heat' over neutrality,"Joe Biden says India has been ""somewhat shaky"" in its response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine.",Ukraine: India feeling the heat over neutrality Soutik Biswas India correspondent Published 25 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption India has doggedly pursued a foreign policy based on non-alignment On Monday US President Joe Biden told a meeting of business leaders in Washington that among the so-called Quad group of nations India was being somewhat shaky in its response to Vladimir Putin\s invasion of Ukraine. The US Japan and Australia - the three other members of this coalition formed to counter China\s influence - have been extremely strong in terms of dealing with Putin\s aggression he said. India however has doggedly pursued a non-aligned foreign policy since independence where according to the first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru we will stay away from the big blocs…to be friendly to all countries…not join any alliance. But will the war in Ukraine now put Indias fabled neutrality under strain? Uncharted territory India is feeling the heat no doubt about it Michael Kugelman deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center a Washington-based think tank says. Fence-sitting is a bigger diplomatic gamble now than in the past given that Russia\s invasion of Ukraine is one of the worst aggressions in decades and India\s relations with the West have never been stronger. India has abstained from voting in the United Nations - three times in a week - on resolutions condemning Russia. There have been reports of a surge of Indian imports of discounted Russian oil as energy prices spiked in the wake of the war. And it has pointedly stopped short of criticising Russia which it has called a longstanding and time-tested friend in the past. The two countries share a decades-old relationship harking back to the Cold War and Russia is also Indias biggest defence supplier. The US is now trying to persuade India that things have changed. For one the relationship between the two countries has deepened - bilateral trade between India and the US is $150bn compared to $8bn between India and Russia. US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland visited Delhi this week and had in her own words broad and deep conversations with Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and senior officials. She acknowledged the historical relationship between India and Russia but said times have changed now and there was an evolution of thinking in India. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption PM Modi with President Putin in 2021 - India and Russia have a historical relationship Ms Nuland told journalists that the US and Europe were willing to be strong defence and security partners of India. She said US could help wean India off its dependence on Russian defence supplies. The war was a major inflection point in the autocratic-democratic struggle in which India\s support was needed she noted. Such an explicit message from the US Mr Kugelman says may well be uncharted territory. But Indian experts are loathe to believe that the country is under diplomatic pressure. Why India is not criticising Russia over Ukraine They point to the fact that other Quad members have been sympathetic to India and that the US itself had acknowledged India\s humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. If there\s one country which is isolated in the Quad it\s not India it\s the US says former Indian diplomat Jitendra Nath Misra. And weakening a strategic partner through sanctions - for buying Russian arms or oil - doesnt benefit the US which wants India to play counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific. Strategically neutral At the same time Indias close ties with Russia do not mean that it has been aloof to the crisis in Ukraine experts say. They point to the joint statement issued last week by Mr Modi and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida during the latter\s visit to Delhi: the two leaders expressed their serious concern about the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. They also emphasised that the contemporary global order has been built on the UN Charter international law and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of states. Mr Modi has spoken to both President Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urging them to end the violence. His government managed to get more than 22000 Indians out of Ukraine in 90 evacuation flights. IMAGE SOURCE AFP Image caption Russia is supplying equipment like the S-400 missile defence system to India Former diplomat Anil Triguniyat who served in Moscow says President Biden\s remark that India\s response was shaky was possibly a joke of some kind. India\s position has been consistent and principled all through. India has stood for diplomacy dialogue respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine he says. We have to be strategically neutral. There\s no other way. Happymon Jacob a professor of foreign policy at Delhi\s Jawaharlal Nehru University believes that the heat hasn\t really increased on India and it is managing the contradictions quite well. The question is whether India could have done more he says. Can India do more? The jury is out on this. Although India had managed the crisis admirably it should have called a spade a spade… It is an invasion it is a war India\s former foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon told The Wire. It affects your credibility if you don\t he added. But Delhi\s special relationship with Moscow - fraught with nostalgia and deep trust as Mr Kugelman describes it - means that it won\t easily turn against its ally. These sentiments die hard even after Russia has launched a massive cold-blooded invasion. But at the same time India doesn\t want to alienate its ties with the West. One way to avoid alienation say experts is for India to offer itself as a third-party mediator - something which Ukraines Ambassador to India Igor Polikha had urged at the beginning of the war. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption India has provided humanitarian aid - medicines medical equipment relief material - to Ukraine India can leverage its deep ties to Moscow and cordial relations with Kyiv and try to push both sides to de-escalate Mr Kugelman says.

But if Delhi is at least making an effort to bring about de-escalation that should pre-empt potential tensions with the West over India\s refusal to take the West\s side. Mr Jacob echoes the sentiment saying when Ukrainians asked for mediation India could have taken up the offer. India still has the opportunity. It should still go ahead and offer itself as a neutral mediator. After all India needs both US and Russia on its side to help manage its fraught relationship with China. Last year the two neighbours faced off against each other along their disputed border in the Himalayan region. In the long term Mr Triguniyat says India should pursue a policy of strategic autonomy - not far removed from non-alignment -and initiate a grouping of nations for strategic unity to serve their development interests in a much more severe Cold War 2.0 that is likely to emerge after the war in Ukraine. Former Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran has said the nightmare scenario for India would be if the US comes to the conclusion that it confronts a greater threat from Russia and that this justifies a strategic accommodation with China. Bluntly this means concede Chinese dominance in Asia while safeguarding its European flank. That\s a nightmare India will never get used to.

Cardiff Half Marathon 2022: Latest updates Half marathon postponement tough for charities I managed to convince my mum to leave the city but my grandmother refuses to leave even though the Russians have bombed Kharkiv almost out of existence. She lost half her flat in a raid. It was heart-breaking to hear my mum full of fear and uncertainty while I am safe. My grandmother tells me how scared she is to possibly lose her life in such an unfair way. Many of my friends are spending days underground in basements simply trying to stay alive. I\m lucky to be where I am and felt I had to try to do something anything to help raise money and awareness.

She survived the accident which killed her friend Savannah but was knocked unconscious and woke up unable to walk after breaking both her legs. After months of intense rehabilitation she was told she would probably never be able to run again. Five years on and she was running in her friends memory. I don\t like being told I can\t do something she said. I was told… \don\t think about it - you\re going to have arthritic knees - just don\t go down it. It won\t be good for you\. I went to a physio myself and said \Do you think I can?\ - and she said \why not?\. Because I was serious about it I thought I\m going to do this.

Mentally - getting rid of the \I can\t walk I can\t run\ - that\s been the hardest thing for me she said. That\s far bigger than the physical. That for me was the hardest thing. I\d been in this accident. My legs didn\t work like they should. Even to stand up for the first time I felt so heavy. My legs had no weight through them for months. So much of it is mental. You\ve just got to learn to trust your body and so going from nothing to walking was hard enough. Getting into the running was just trial and error. Putting one foot in front of the other and we\ll see what happens. Emotional Image caption Crossing the finish line will be overwhelming for Hannah Barrett Alongside conquering her injuries Hannah also has type 1 diabetes and is raising money for the Diabetes Research and Wellness Foundation. She said she would be thinking of her friend Savannah as she crossed the finish line. She\s with me every day. We were both 26 when we had the accident. Her life finished at 26 and I think about all these things that I want to do with my life - and I can she said. I know she\d be thinking I was crazy. But too many people in society don\t push boundaries. They don\t push outside their comfort zone. I think life is actually outside your comfort zone.

War in Ukraine: UK unveils new Russia sanctions as PM aims at gold reserves,The UK reveals more sanctions as Boris Johnson and other Nato leaders meet to discuss the war in Ukraine.,War in Ukraine: UK unveils new Russia sanctions as PM aims at gold reserves By Christy Cooney BBC News Published 24 March comments Comments Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS The West should consider ways to stop Russia using its gold reserves to prop up the rouble the prime minister said. Boris Johnsons comments came as the UK announced sanctions on 65 more groups and individuals including a private military firm and a major Russian bank. Speaking ahead of a Nato summit the PM said the UK and the West must tighten the economic vice on Vladimir Putin. He said Russia crossed red lines by targeting Ukrainian civilians and tough steps now could help shorten the war. In addition to the new raft of financial sanctions the UK government has announced plans to send 6000 more missiles to Ukraine. Leaders from Nato the EU and the G7 are holding emergency meetings in Brussels to discuss the ongoing situation in Ukraine. On Thursday Nato announced the creation of new battle groups in Bulgaria Hungary Romania and Slovakia while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky used a virtual address to urge the bloc to increase its supply of military equipment. Ahead of the talks Mr Johnson said that by deliberately bombing civilian centres Putin had already crossed the red line into barbarism. We\ve got to step up. We\ve got to increase our support he said. We\ve got to tighten the economic vice around Putin sanctioning more people today as we are sanctioning the Wagner Group looking at what we can do to stop Putin using his gold reserves. In an interview with LBC he added: We need to do more economically. Can we do more to stop him Putin] using his gold reserves for instance in addition to his cash reserves? The more pressure we apply now particularly on things like gold I believe the more we can shorten the war … And then we need to do more to give the Ukrainians military support. As Mr Putin invaded Ukraine the Russian Central Bank deployed some of its $640bn war chest of currency and gold reserves to prop up the Russian rouble.

Also targeted were Gazprombank the countrys third-largest bank and one of the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas and the state-run shipping firm Sovcomflot. The reported step-daughter of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov Polina Kovaleva who is thought to own a London property worth an estimated £4million was also targeted by the measures. Western leaders meet to discuss Ukraine support Zelensky calls on people to protest to support freedom In his speech to Nato leaders Mr Zelensky called on them to give or sell Ukraine more tanks and anti-aircraft defence systems. I don\t want to blame Nato. I understand this is not you he said. These are not your missiles or bombs which are destroying our cities. I simply want you to know the alliance still can prevent Ukrainian deaths… by providing us all the munitions we are asking for. The summit follows an announcement by the UK government that it would be providing Ukraine with an additional 6000 anti-tank and other missiles. The UK has already sent 4000 anti-tank weapons but will now send another 3000 plus a similar number of what Downing Street described as high explosive missiles. The prime minister is also expected to set out plans to offer more help to Ukraine with intelligence and longer-range combat. Ukrainian officials indicated this week the countrys armed forces had the equipment they needed to stop tanks at short range but needed more that would help them do the same over longer distances. The UK will also send an additional £25m in aid to help Ukraine pay the salaries of its armed forces. The government has already given £400m in humanitarian and economic aid to Ukraine and neighbouring nations since Russias invasion.

Ukraine war: Liz Truss says Russia sanctions should end only after withdrawal,"Russia must commit to no further aggression or face them being reimposed, the foreign secretary says.",Ukraine war: Liz Truss says Russia sanctions should end only after withdrawal Published 7 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EPA Sanctions on Russia are a hard lever that should only be removed following a full ceasefire and withdrawal from Ukraine the foreign secretary says. Liz Truss told the Sunday Telegraph that Moscow would also have to commit to no further aggression or face the prospect of them being reimposed. The West had to remain tough to get peace she said. The UK US and EU have so far imposed sanctions on over 1000 Russian individuals and businesses. This week saw Moscow announce it would be refocusing its military operations in Ukraine to the countrys east. The move was interpreted by many as a sign that the Kremlin was looking to scale back an invasion that has so far made significantly less progress than was widely expected. Ms Truss said that a negotiations unit had been set up to assist Ukraine once the Russians were serious about negotiations but added: I don\t believe they are serious at present. That\s why... we need to double down on sanctions she said. The foreign secretary has previously said she believes the peace talks are a smokescreen designed to distract from Russia\s actions and allow its armed forces time to regroup.

READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis It comes after the government announced it had detained indefinitely two jets owned by Russian oligarch Eugene Shvidler who had been sanctioned over his ties with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. The jets estimated to be worth $60m (£45m) were seized at Farnborough and Biggin Hill airports following a three-week investigation. Ms Truss said she believed more should have been done to deter Mr Putin following his annexation of Crimea in 2014. So there needs to be hard levers she said. Of course sanctions are a hard lever. Those sanctions should only come off with a full ceasefire and withdrawal but also commitments that there will be no further aggression. She added that snapback sanctions could be used in the event of more aggression in the future. IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption Eugene Shvidler (right) has been sanctioned over his ties with longstanding business partner Roman Abramovich As well as sanctions on individuals recent weeks have seen dozens of countries impose bans on the export of luxury goods to Russia and close their airspace to Russian airlines. Some Russian banks have also been banned from using Swift the system used to manage international payments and efforts are underway to explore how Europe can reduce its dependency on Russian oil and gas. Ms Truss\s comments echo those of US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken who said this month that the sanctions on Russia were not designed to be permanent. Mr Blinken said the sanctions could go away in the event of an irreversible withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. However speaking in Poland on Saturday President Biden said that while sanctions were weakening Russia the West needed to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead. Asked about ongoing disagreements with the EU about the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol which sets out the post-Brexit trading arrangements between Northern Ireland and the EU Ms Truss said that countries would always have differences that we need to resolve. But those types of differences between friends and allies are different from the scale and the sheer belligerence and aggression and lying of Russia she said. She added that given the scale of their differences with Russia it was vital that Western countries stick together.

Ukraine daily round-up: Biden meets Ukrainian ministers,The talks came as Russia faced more counter-attacks and another of its generals was reported killed.,Ukraine daily round-up: Biden meets Ukrainian ministers Published 26 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS US President Joe Biden has held his first face-to-face talks with Ukrainian government ministers since their country was invaded by Russia. In Warsaw he met Ukraines defence and foreign ministers Oleksii Reznikov and Dmytro Kuleba. Some say the fact the ministers left Ukraine for the talks is a sign of growing confidence in how the war with Russia is going. Mr Kuleba said they had received additional pledges from the US president on developing defence co-operation. Mr Biden said stability in Europe was critically important to US interests and that whenever Washington had stayed out of crises in Europe it had come back to bite the country. But the US president also made some fiery comments on Saturday. Meeting Ukrainian refugees in Poland Mr Biden called the Russian president a butcher - something unlikely to help strained US-Russia relations. Then later in a speech in front of Warsaw\s historic royal castle he addressed the Russian people telling them: For God\s sake this man cannot remain in power. That led to a stern message from the Kremlin that the president of Russia is elected by Russians - and not the US president. Separately a White House spokesperson told the media that Mr Biden was not calling for regime change with the remark - merely making a point about Mr Putin\s attempt to exercise power over other countries. In Ukraine itself officials said three powerful explosions had rocked the western city of Lviv. Thick black smoke was seen rising over the outskirts of the city. The cause of the blasts is not known but city officials warned residents to remain indoors. Saboteurs or spectres? Image caption Bohdan had to make a police statement after a neighbour reported his fairy lights Since the war began there have been rumours of Russian saboteurs among the Ukrainian population - malicious agents acting from within. But how much of it is real?

Holding some fairy lights 22-year-old Bohdan explained the red light in his window had brought the police to his door. I had to go to the police station and get my documents checked he said. But Capt Volodymir Kalina from the Odesa police is clear: This is not paranoia. There are Russian agents and citizens of Ukraine working against us. That\s a fact. Read the full story here.

He was the commander of Russias 49th combined army. A western official said he was the seventh general to die in Ukraine and the second lieutenant general - the highest rank officer reportedly killed. It is thought that low morale among Russian troops has forced senior officers closer to the front line. Ukrainian media reported on Friday that the general was killed at the Chornobaivka airbase near Kherson which Russia is using as a command post and has been attacked by Ukraines military several times. Another lieutenant general Andrei Mordvichev was reportedly killed by a Ukrainian strike on the same base last week. Read the full report by Ben Tobias here.

Ukraine war: Chernobyl’s vodka producer remains defiant,"A company that produces Chernobyl’s ‘Atomik vodka’ releases new products, donating profits to Ukraine's refugees.",Ukraine war: Chernobyl’s vodka producer remains defiant By Victoria Gill Science correspondent BBC News Published 7 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE ATOMIK Image caption There are now three varieties of Atomik Chernobyl fruit spirit It started with Chernobyl moonshine. Scientists who were studying crops grown in the Chernobyl exclusion zone decided to use some of their leftover grain to produce alcohol. That experiment became a social enterprise that made and sold a spirit drink called appropriately enough Atomik. The aim was to show that slightly radioactive fruit grown in orchards in or near the contaminated exclusion zone that surrounds Chernobyls nuclear power plant could be distilled into a spirit that was no more radioactive than any other. Profits were channelled into communities that live in deprived areas close to the zone. Now as Russian troops occupy the land where that fruit is grown and harvested this unusual company is making a defiant marketing move by releasing two more premium drinks and donating profits to help Ukraine\s refugees. Image caption The land around the nuclear power plant abandoned since the 1986 accident is now occupied by Russian forces While the future of an enterprise that makes a niche spirit might seem insignificant amid the ongoing crisis in Ukraine it is an example of how decades of progress has been upended by war. Why there was a radiation spike at Chernobyl Chernobyl vodka made in exclusion zone After 30 years of studying the exclusion zone the scientists who set up the Atomik project enabled people on contaminated land to sell their own produce. It was a small but significant milestone in the recovery of a patch of Ukraine that was largely abandoned after the nuclear catastrophe in 1986. Now that whole region where we harvest our fruit for production is occupied by Russian forces explained Kyrylo Korychenskyi an environmental researcher and member of the Atomik team. Russian forces seized control of the now defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the first few days of the invasion. Image caption The damaged reactor is entombed by a steel confinement structure Military machinery kicking up radioactive dust in the usually carefully controlled zone caused a spike in radiation levels. The information we\re getting from the region is very bad says Kyrylo. Russian forces go into the villages and put their tanks in the middle of people\s gardens. In the heart of the exclusion zone Ukrainian authorities have accused Russian forces of looting and destroying a new research laboratory designed to process and analyse radioactive samples and to monitor the zone. Prof Jim Smith is one of the founders of Atomik and a scientist at the University of Portsmouth. He has spent much of his career studying the exclusion zone and says that decades of progress are now being destroyed. IMAGE SOURCE ATOMIK Image caption Kyrylo Korychenskyi at the distillery before the war in Ukraine The communities who have been suffering for 35 years are now suffering even more he told BBC News. We used to worry about the risk from radioactive strontium in cities] that are now being bombed. The future of the Atomik project - and that of the people who live and grow fruit in their orchards near the exclusion zone - is uncertain. If the war has ended by the time the next harvest season comes around Kyrylo - who remains in his home in Kyiv with his wife and children - says he hopes to keep going. He hopes to go back to his pre-war life and pick up the project where he left off. I think people there will need money and help because the Chernobyl accident for this territory will no longer be the worst thing that happened there. Follow Victoria on Twitter]
G7: What is the G7 and what is it doing about Ukraine?,"Leaders of the G7, the world's richest nations, are meeting to discuss the Russian invasion of Ukraine.",G7: What is the G7 and what is it doing about Ukraine? Published 24 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE PHOTONEWS VIA GETTY IMAGES Image caption US President Joe Biden will attend G7 Nato and EU summits in Brussels Leaders of the worlds seven richest nations are gathering in Brussels to decide what further measures to take against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. They are holding an emergency summit on the same day that leaders of Nato and the EU also meet in Brussels. Ukraine\s President Volodymyr Zelensky says the trio of meetings will show who is our friend who is our partner and who sold us out and betrayed us. Western leaders meet to discuss Ukraine support What is the G7? The G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world\s seven largest so-called advanced economies which dominate global trade and the international financial system. They are Canada France Germany Italy Japan the UK and the United States. Russia joined in 1998 creating the G8 but was excluded in 2014 for its takeover of Crimea. China has never been a member despite its large economy and having the worlds biggest population. Its relatively low level of wealth per person means its not seen as an advanced economy in the way the G7 members are. Throughout the year G7 ministers and officials hold meetings form agreements and publish joint statements on global events. Germany took over the G7 presidency in January 2022 which means it will host the organisations annual summit in June. The EU is not a member of the G7 but attends the annual summit. What is the G7 doing about Ukraine? Between them the G7 nations have already imposed on Russia the biggest package of sanctions ever imposed on a large economy. They have blocked the country from international commerce and the global financial system and they have frozen the assets of its wealthiest individuals. G7 countries who are members of the Nato security alliance have also provided Ukraine with weapons and other military equipment. What is Nato and how is it helping Ukraine? IMAGE SOURCE NUR VIA GETTY IMAGES Image caption Volodymyr Zelensky says the G7 meeting will show who is our friend ... and who sold us out and betrayed us. What else could G7 countries do? The question is whether G7 leaders are prepared to take harsher steps against Russia which would also hurt their own economies. One key issue is whether to restrict completely the import of Russian oil and gas. The US is banning all Russian oil and gas imports and the UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Ukraines leaders are keen for other G7 nations to follow suit. However European nations get a quarter of their oil and 40% of their gas from Russia and so far the EU has only agreed to reduce its Russian gas imports by two-thirds. Germany has already suspended progress of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. It is designed to take gas from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to Lubmin in Germany under the Baltic Sea. IMAGE SOURCE AFP Image caption Nord Stream 2 would have doubled gas exports to Germany But in a tweet the Ukrainian foreign ministry urged member states to go further calling on leaders to stop financing the war stop paying for Russian energy. One suggested solution is for European nations to strike a deal with the US to import more of its liquefied natural gas. The G7 summit could provide an opportunity to discuss this option. Does the G7 have any power? It cant pass any laws because it is made up of separate nations with their own democratic processes. However some of its past decisions have had global effects. For example the G7 played crucial role in setting up a global fund to fight malaria and Aids in 2002. Ahead of the 2021 G7 summit in the UK the G7 finance ministers agreed to make multinational companies pay more tax. It has also provided financial aid to developing countries and addressed climate change. Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Economics Diplomacy Ukraine G7]

But by donating to this fund you can show you care by helping to provide practical help and support right here in Manchester to those escaping danger and starting to rebuild their lives.

Ukraine: Sadiq Khan says UK should do more to help refugees,"The London mayor calls the actions of the government ""embarrassing"" compared with other countries.",Ukraine: Sadiq Khan says UK should do more to help refugees Published 26 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE AARON CHOWN/PA WIRE Image caption Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the actions of the UK government were embarrassing compared to other countries The UK should be doing much more to help Ukrainian refugees London mayor Sadiq Khan has said. Mr Khan joined a large crowd that gathered near Hyde Park ahead of a march in solidarity with the war-torn country. The Labour mayor said the actions of the UK government compared with other European countries were embarrassing. Mr Khan said it needed to be made much more easier for those who are fleeing Ukraine to come here. Earlier this month the government opened it Homes for Ukraine scheme which allows UK nationals to individually sponsor a Ukrainian nationals visa so that those without family connections can still come to live with a host family in the UK. Image caption The crowd carried flags and banners as they marched through London Protesters made their way towards Trafalgar Square whilst holding Ukrainian flags and banners that said stop Putin\s war no fly zone and solidarity with Ukraine. The crowd chanted we stand with Ukraine as traffic behind was brought to a standstill. About 10 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine because of the Russian invasion the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said. As well as the 3.6 million who have left for neighbouring countries another estimated 6.5 million people are thought to be displaced inside the war-torn country itself. At the scene By Chi Chi Izundu BBC News A group of children clutching balloons in the colours of the Ukrainian flag marched in the heat of the sun in central London leading todays protest. Joined by thousands of others mini flags were being handed out for people to show their solidarity. A sea of blue and yellow surrounded Nelsons column as special guests addressed the crowd trying to teach Ukrainian phrases. Most of the people that we stopped to speak to were either Ukrainian born or had Ukrainian links like Olaksana. She told us that her family had just fled Kharkiv and were in Hungary and Germany. She said: It is really hard to be in another country when your country is suffering. The least I can do is come to this protest and the least I can do is stand with Ukraine and unite as a nation and show the world they\re not going to kill us as a nation. IMAGE SOURCE AARON CHOWN/PA WIRE Image caption Cheers rang out as a message from Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky was played in front of Nelsons Column Mr Khan praised the actions of Londoners who had shown that we\re opening our arms to Ukrainian refugees whether it\s by donating money to those charities doing a brilliant job in Ukraine or by opening our homes to those fleeing Ukraine. I\m full of admiration for anybody who has the space to provide a room for those who have fled Ukraine he said. It\s really important families are not left to their own devices the government has to step up and support them. The BBC has contacted the Home Office for comment.

Western leaders meet to discuss Ukraine support,"President Joe Biden joins leaders of Nato, the EU and G7 in response to the invasion of Ukraine.",Western leaders meet to discuss Ukraine support By Jessica Parker in Brussels & Jonathan Beale in Norway BBC News Published 24 March comments Comments Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption President Biden is expected to discuss natural gas supplies as the EU moves to reduce exposure to Russia US President Joe Biden joins fellow Western leaders in Brussels on Thursday for three summits on Russias war in Ukraine a month after the invasion began. Nato the G7 and the EU are all holding meetings in a display of unity rarely seen by the West. Mr Biden will take part in all three the first ever visit by a US president to an EU summit in Brussels. But his visit to Brussels is not just about symbolism. Russias invasion of Ukraine has given the Western defensive alliance Nato a renewed sense of purpose. And as the EU attempts to sever energy ties with Russia it needs to forge and reinforce other relationships particularly with the US. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was due to appear by video link at all three summits. Natos 30 presidents and prime ministers will agree greater support for Ukraine and new troop deployments for Eastern allies. Their aim is to show solidarity to Kyiv though only up to a point. Many but not all have been willing to supply weapons. The UK said it would use both the G7 and Nato meetings to substantively increase defensive lethal aid to Ukraine. But the alliance has also made clear it wont become more directly involved and Mr Zelenskys repeated requests for a no-fly zone over Ukraine have pretty much been ignored. Nor is it clear how Nato would respond if Russia were to dramatically escalate the conflict in Ukraine - such as an attack on a Western weapons convoy the use of chemical or even tactical nuclear weapons. Natos red lines have so far been drawn at its borders. Why cant Ukraine join Nato? Collective defence For the past few weeks 30000 Nato troops from 25 countries have been training in Norway as part of Exercise Cold Response a long-planned exercise that has now taken on more significance. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Soldiers from Sweden which is not part of Nato joined thousands of troops on exercise in Norway Like Ukraine Norway borders Russia. The key difference is that as a Nato member Norway is covered by a commitment to collective defence - an attack on one is an attack on all. I think an exercise like this is pretty good to have to prove to countries like Russia… that you don\t want to mess with Nato a young Norwegian conscript called Peder told the BBC. Nato leaders are focused on how to boost their own defences. Theyve already sent thousands more troops to the alliances eastern flank along with more air defence batteries warships and aircraft. Five challenges for Biden in Europe Nato to send more troops to Eastern Europe This says Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is the new normal following Russia\s invasion of Ukraine. Russia will get exactly what it didn\t want - more not less Nato near its border. Nato battlegroups will stretch all the way from the Baltic to the Black Sea for the foreseeable future. Two EU countries that are not members of Nato - Sweden and Finland - contributed troops to the exercise in Norway. They appear to be edging closer and closer to Nato in the wake of Russias invasion. President Trump once questioned the very existence of Nato and French President Emmanuel Macron once called it brain dead. But President Biden\s visit to Brussels is proof that he sees it as being more important than ever to curb a more aggressive Russia. Dizzying EU unity Defence strategy will also play a part in an EU summit where leaders will approve plans that aim to pull member states closer together on military planning intelligence and procurement. One ambition is to have a rapidly deployable force of 5000 troops. It\s all part of the theme of strategic autonomy championed by Mr Macron. The argument is that a more sovereign Europe is a safer Europe whether thats by securing reliable supplies of energy and semiconductor chips or by boosting military spending. But the trickiest subject for the European Unions 27 member states is fast becoming the future of energy supplies as they try to look beyond Russia. After an initial dizzying display of unity on sanctions across all 27 member states there are now obvious ruptures over what to do next. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption EU leaders have reacted fast to Russias invasion with a series of hard-hitting sanctions German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has publicly denounced the idea of banning Russian gas and oil imports arguing it will drag Europe into a recession. Sanctions must not hit the European states harder than the Russian leadership. That is our principle he said on the eve of the summit. Blood money Soaring energy prices are also a concern to be discussed by EU leaders on Friday. But there are nations agitating for action as they voice deep discomfort about handing cash to the Kremlin via energy payments. It\s blood money said one central European diplomat. I don\t think some countries understand the gravity of the situation. President Bidens ability to offer Europe more US Liquefied Natural Gas is a key watch at Thursdays summit. The US is the worlds largest producer of natural gas. He is also expected to announce more sanctions on Russian political figures as well as so-called oligarchs. But the prospect of fresh EU sanctions this week is being played down. Some in Brussels call it fatigue while others insist it\s the right time to take stock.

What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion?,Western nations have imposed severe sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.,What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion? Published 24 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Measures designed to damage Russias economy have been introduced by countries opposed to its invasion of Ukraine. This has led to higher prices for Russian households and shortages of some goods. What are sanctions? Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another to stop it acting aggressively or breaking international law. They are among the toughest actions nations can take short of going to war. What sanctions have been imposed on Russia? Military goods and mercenaries A ban on the export of dual-use goods - items with both a civilian and military purpose such as vehicle parts - has been imposed by the UK EU and US. This is reportedly having an impact on some Russian manufacturers. Ukraine says Russias main armoured vehicle factory has run out of parts to make and repair tanks. It also says a tractor plant has stopped production because of a shortage of foreign-made parts. The UK is also imposing sanctions on Russias Wagner Group - a private military firm thought to function as an arms-length unit of the Russian military. Flights All Russian flights have been banned from US UK EU and Canadian airspace. The UK has also banned private jets chartered by Russians. Luxury goods The UK says it will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia - including vehicles high-end fashion and art. The EU has already imposed a ban. The UK will also put a 35% tax on some imports from Russia including vodka. Targeting individuals The US EU and UK have together sanctioned over 1000 Russian individuals and businesses including wealthy business leaders known as oligarchs who are considered close to the Kremlin. One high-profile oligarch sanctioned by the UK is Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich. IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption Roman Abramovich was attempting to sell Chelsea FC Assets belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov are also being frozen in the US EU UK and Canada. However many Russian oligarchs have put their properties and wealth under other names which means they may be beyond the reach of the UKs sanctions. The UK is also limiting the sale of golden visas which allowed wealthy Russians to get British residency rights. The hunt for superyachts of sanctioned Russians Oil and gas The US is banning all Russian oil and gas imports and the UK will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. The EU which gets a quarter of its oil and 40% of its gas from Russia says it will switch to alternative supplies and make Europe independent from Russian energy well before 2030. Germany has put on hold permission for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to open. Could the world survive without Russian oil and gas? Financial measures Western countries have frozen the assets of Russias central bank to stop it using its $630bn (£470bn) of foreign currency reserves. This has caused the value of the rouble to slump by 22% since the start of the year. That in turn has pushed up the price of imported goods and led to a 14% rise in Russias rate of inflation. Some Russian banks are being removed from the international financial messaging system Swift which is used to transfer money across borders. This will delay payments to Russia for energy exports. Other UK sanctions include: major Russian banks excluded from the UK financial system all Russian banks have had their assets frozen the Russian state and major companies are not be able to raise finance or borrow money in the UK a limit placed on deposits Russians can make at UK banks The EU also said it would target 70% of the Russian banking market and key state-owned firms. What are companies doing? A growing number of international companies including McDonalds Coca-Cola and Starbucks have suspended trading in Russia. After facing fierce criticism for continuing to operate in Russia Nestle has withdrawn some of its brands including KitKat and Nesquik but will still sell essential foods. However a number of other Western brands including Marks and Spencer Burger King and hotel groups Marriott and Accor say they cant pull out from Russia because their businesses there operate under complex franchise deals. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia How has Russia reacted to sanctions? Russia\s President Putin has said he will make unfriendly nations pay for their imports of Russian gas in roubles which would push up the value of the currency. Russia has banned exports of more than 200 products until the end of 2022 including telecoms medical vehicle agricultural electrical equipment and timber. In addition it is blocking interest payments to foreign investors who hold government bonds and banning Russian firms from paying overseas shareholders. It has stopped foreign investors who hold billions of dollars worth of Russian stocks and bonds from selling them. Could Russia turn to China as sanctions bite?

Russian general Yakov Rezantsev killed in Ukraine,Western officials believe low morale among Russian troops is forcing generals to the battlefield.,Russian general Yakov Rezantsev killed in Ukraine By Ben Tobias BBC News Published 26 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE DENIS NASIK/WIKIMEDIACOMMONS Image caption Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed in the Kherson region Ukraines defence ministry says another Russian general Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was killed in a strike near the southern city of Kherson. Rezantsev was the commander of Russias 49th combined army. A western official said he was the seventh general to die in Ukraine and the second lieutenant general - the highest rank officer reportedly killed. It is thought that low morale among Russian troops has forced senior officers closer to the front line. In a conversation intercepted by the Ukrainian military a Russian soldier complained that Rezantsev had claimed the war would be over within hours just four days after it began. Ukrainian media reported on Friday that the general was killed at the Chornobaivka airbase near Kherson which Russia is using as a command post and has been attacked by Ukraines military several times. Another lieutenant general Andrei Mordvichev was reportedly killed by a Ukrainian strike on the same base. Kherson was the first Ukrainian city to be occupied by Russian forces although there are reports that daily protests are held there against the Russian occupation. Although Russia has confirmed the death of only one general Kyiv and western officials believe up to seven have been killed in fighting since the war began. However the death of Maj Gen Magomed Tushayev of the Chechen national guard has been disputed. It is unusual for such senior Russian officers to be so close to the battlefield and western officials believe that they have been forced to move towards the front lines to deal with low morale among Russian troops. The unexpectedly strong Ukrainian resistance poor Russian equipment and a high death toll amongst Russian troops are all thought to be contributing to the low morale. Russian forces are believed to be relying in part on open communication systems for example mobile phones and analogue radios which are easy to intercept and could give away the locations of high-ranking officers. A person inside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskys inner circle told the Wall Street Journal that Ukraine had a military intelligence team dedicated to targeting Russias officer class. So far Vladimir Putin has only referred to the death of one general thought to be Maj Gen Andrey Sukhovetsky in a speech soon after the start of the war. Russia says 1351 soldiers have died since the war began in Ukraine although Kyiv and western officials say the number is much higher. Russias lost generals Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed by a Ukrainian strike on the Chornobaivka airbase near the city of Kherson. He was promoted to lieutenant general last year and was commander of the 49th combined army of Russias southern military district. He is said to have taken part in Russias military operation in Syria. Andrei Mordvichev was killed by a strike on the Chornobaivka airbase near Kherson according to Ukrainian officials. He was the commander of Russias 8th combined army of the southern military district. His death was reported on 18 March. Maj Gen Oleg Mityaev reportedly died somewhere near the city of Mariupol a city in south-east Ukraine which has seen some of the heaviest fighting so far. The nationalist Azov regiment claims to have killed him. He was a commander of the Russian armys 150th motorised rifle division a relatively new unit formed in 2016 and based in the Rostov region close to the Ukrainian border. Ukraine claims that the unit was created in order to take part in the conflict in separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine although Russia denies that its military was involved in fighting there. Maj Gen Andrei Kolesnikov of the 29th combined army was killed in fighting on 11 March according to official Ukrainian sources. The circumstances of his death were not given. After Kolesnikov became the third Russian general reportedly killed in Ukraine one western official told the Press Association that the Russian army may be suffering from low morale which is why high-ranking military officers are moving closer to the front line. Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov chief of staff of Russias 41st combined army was killed on 7 March outside the eastern city of Kharkiv according to Ukraines defence ministry. Kharkiv close to the Russian border has come under sustained attack from Russian forces. Ukraines military released a recording of what it said was two Russian security service officials discussing Gerasimovs death and complaining that their secure communication networks no longer worked in Ukraine. Gerasimov was involved in the second Chechen war the Russian military operation in Syria and in the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. Maj Gen Andrey Sukhovetsky a deputy commander at the same unit as Gerasimov was reportedly killed by a sniper on 3 March. Like Gerasimov Sukhovetsky was part of Russias military operations in Crimea and in Syria. Unlike the other generals Sukhovetskys death was reported in the Russian media and Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed in a speech that a general had died in Ukraine.

The two jets belonging to billionaire oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler had been under investigation at Farnborough and Biggin Hill airports for three weeks. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Russian President Vladimir] Putin\s friends should not enjoy luxuries while innocent people die in Ukraine. Mr Shvidler was sanctioned over ties with Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich. The government said Mr Shvidler a former boss and shareholder in Mr Abramovichs steel giant Evraz PLC was associated with a person benefitting from or supporting the Russian government. Luxury toys His net worth has been estimated at £1.2bn the government says while the seized jets are believed to be worth up to $60m (£45m). Mr Shapps said in a statement: Introducing these latest measures - detaining tens of millions of pounds worth of Russian private jets - shows this government will leave no stone unturned in depriving Putin\s cronies of their luxury toys. A private helicopter belonging to Russian firm HeliCo Group LLC has also been detained. Western nations opposed to the Russian presidents invasion of Ukraine have introduced a raft of sanctions designed to cripple Russias economy and hurt its wealthiest citizens. The UK has made it a criminal offence for planes owned operated or chartered by Russians - including private jets - to fly or land in the UK. Ukraine said it had inflicted powerful blows and significant losses on the Russians. But Russias army said the first phase of its military campaign in Ukraine is over and it will now focus on the eastern Donbas region.]

How charity speedrunning made gaming the new telethon Afghanistan War veteran who lost both legs says gaming saved his life Mother turned into ghost gamer for homeless charity Humble Bundle for example sells collections of video games online with proceeds usually benefitting both the developers and charities. But in its latest offering Humble has raised more than £10m exclusively for charities benefitting Ukraine. It is providing a bundle of 120 games and items usually valued at more than £1800 that it now offers for a minimum donation of only £30.52. Kamini Tiwari vice-president of social impact at Humble praised the players who have put up their money to get the games. We\re very very happy that our community is leaning in to support us she said. I think they also like us recognise that need is so great. We are constantly humbled - pardon the pun - by our community. Throughout the year and particularly during times of crisis and disaster it\s been great to see that across the gaming industry so many others are leaning in as well. Chucklefish Games makers of WarGroove and Starbound is one of the independent developers based in London that has offered up its games to the bundle. Alexis Trust communications manager at the studio said she felt it was their duty to help those in need. She said the firm\s partners Lithuania-based Hidden Layer Games which made the game Inmost is a two-man team from Ukraine and Russia. Throughout the project the team experienced first-hand the difficulty of working between borders during a time of political tension and so made the difficult decision to move together to Lithuania where their dream project could actually become a reality. When the Russian military invaded Ukraine we felt that it was our duty to extend that help to other families in whatever capacity we could. IMAGE SOURCE CHUCKLEFISH GAMES Image caption Chucklefish released indie hit Wargroove in 2019 But Humble isnt the only bundle right now aiming to help those in Ukraine. There is also the now-completed itch.io bundle which raised £4.7m by offering up 1000 games in exchange for a minimum donation of £7.56. Brandon Sheffield creative director of Necrosoft Games organised the bundle. He told the BBC he thinks the cause really resonated with people. And he said it was surprisingly easy to persuade developers of indie hits like Celeste and Superhot to help. Believe it or not it didn\t take very much convincing at all he said. Everyone was pretty much ready to help. The publisher Raw Fury joined the itch.io platform just so that they could put four of their games into this. The charities which benefitted from the itch.io bundle were International Medical Corps as well as the Voices of Children Foundation - a Ukrainian charity which provides support to children affected by trauma caused by war. I feel like that\s incredibly important for the future of Ukraine Mr Sheffield said. I chose this local organisation that\s already there. Because they\re there they\ve been like impromptu shelters going around and using the money that they\ve been donated to try to protect the people in Kyiv and other places where they can actually access them. And Andy Pearson chief marketing officer of British publisher PQube Games that has donated games for the bundle compared what was happening in the games industry to some of the big musical fundraising events of the past. It\s phenomenal. It exceeded the initial expectations and then continued to go on from there. It was amazing. I am thinking now - has this been done before? And it has - it\s like Live Aid - those big big events where you had lots of creators all coming together in one versus a single person trying to contribute. That\s what\s really helped establish this.]

Mr Stoltenberg was speaking at a news conference on the eve of an emergency summit on Russias invasion of Ukraine. He pledged more troops for Hungary Slovakia Bulgaria and Romania. Nato will also agree more support for Ukraine including greater protection against the use of chemical biological and nuclear weapons. US President Joe Biden is on his way to Brussels for the summit on Thursday and for other meetings with European leaders. While he is in Europe the US is expected to announce further sanctions on Russian political figures and oligarchs. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan also said G7 leaders would agree to co-ordinate on sanctions enforcement. The news comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in an address to the French parliament urged a number of major French companies to pull out of Russia. And media reports have emerged that in recent years Israel refused to sell Ukraine its Pegasus spyware system because of fears of provoking Russia.

There is a new sense of urgency because we cannot take peace for granted Mr Stoltenberg told reporters. He warned Russia against using nuclear weapons in Ukraine calling for a halt to Moscow\s dangerous irresponsible nuclear rhetoric. He added that that any use of biological or chemical weapons would have far-reaching consequences while stressing that Nato was ready to protect and defend allies against any threat any time. Meanwhile US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington had concluded following a careful review of available information that Russian forces had committed war crimes by attacking civilians.

"Russia targets east Ukraine, says first phase over",The move is being seen as a possible change of strategy after the invasion faltered.,Russia targets east Ukraine says first phase over Published 26 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Russian forces have made gains in the south and are now looking to control the east Russia says it will focus its invasion of Ukraine on liberating the east signalling a possible shift in its strategy. The defence ministry said that the initial aims of the war were complete and that Russia had reduced the combat capacity of Ukraine. Russias invasion appeared aimed at swiftly capturing major cities and toppling the government. But it has stalled in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance. The main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been carried out said Sergei Rudskoy head of the General Staff\s main operations administration. The combat capabilities of the Ukrainian armed forces have been substantially reduced which allows us to concentrate our main efforts on achieving the main goal: the liberation of Donbas he added referring to an area in eastern Ukraine largely in the hands of Russian-backed separatists. Russias military has been bombarding and trying to encircle key Ukrainian cities such as the capital Kyiv which Gen Rudskoy characterised as an attempt to tie down Ukraines forces elsewhere in the country while Russia focuses on the east. Ukraine\s President Volodymyr Zelensky said his troops had landed powerful blows on Russia and called on Moscow to recognise the need for serious peace talks. By restraining Russia\s actions our defenders are leading the Russian leadership to a simple and logical idea: talk is necessary. Meaningful. Urgent. Fair. For the sake of the result not for the sake of the delay he said. The exact end goal of Russia\s invasion has not been made explicit but President Vladimir Putin described the aims as the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine characterising the government\s leaders as a neo-Nazi junta killing millions in a genocide of Russian speakers. The claims have no basis and Ukraine and its Western allies dismiss them as a pretext to carry out an unprovoked war. Russian troops first tried to encircle the capital Kyiv. But after bombarding and then seizing several towns to the north-west they were forced back by Ukraines military which is now trying to surround thousands of Russian soldiers. In a US assessment on Friday a defence official said that Russia had made no progress in its advance on Ukraines second largest city Kharkiv and that Ukraine could recapture Kherson. Russias army has had greater success in the south seizing towns and cities such as Kherson and making some gains in the east. Moscow now claims 93% of the Donbas region of Luhansk is under the control of Russian-backed separatists with 54% of the other part of Donbas Donetsk in their hands. More than a third of the entire area was under separatist control before the war began. Andriy Yermak chief of staff to Ukraine\s President Zelensky cautioned against the suggestion that Russia had abandoned plans to seize the rest of Ukraine. It\s a big danger before war is finished to make a public prognosis especially when you are fighting against one of the biggest armies in the world Mr Yermak told the Financial Times. What next for Russias war? Russia\s announcement that it will focus on the liberation of the Donbas is likely to mean a more concerted effort to push beyond the line of contact that separates Ukrainian government-held territory in the east of the country from the Russian backed separatist people\s republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. Western officials believe the announcement implies that Moscow knows that its pre-war strategy has failed. Russia is recognising that it can\t pursue its operations on multiple axes simultaneously one official said. As many as 10 new battalion tactical groups are being generated and put into Russias operations especially in the Donbas. Western officials have been concerned for some time that Russia will attempt to encircle and envelop Ukraines best fighting units which are stationed along the line of contact. If more Russian firepower particularly air power is concentrated in the east those concerns will rise. I hope that\s where the Western supply of arms will make a significant contribution to Ukrainian forces one official said. Is Russia admitting invasion not going to plan?

The number is far lower than the number of Russian casualties cited either by Ukraine or the US. Western officials say a seventh Russian general has been killed in action. Analysts have previously suggested Ukraine may be deliberately targeting senior Russian military officers. Ukraines death toll since the war began is now well into the thousands with 10 million people displaced within Ukraine and beyond its borders. So far the UN has only confirmed 1081 civilian deaths in Ukraine but the true number is far higher with 300 deaths reported in the attack on a theatre in Mariupol alone. More than 3.7 million people have fled abroad including 2.2 million to Poland. Russia says more than 400000 have fled there too.]

It has been put forward by the Policy and Resources Committee to record the islands solidarity with Ukraine the committee said. A spokesperson said there is no justification for the horrific violence and history will remember what is happening now. They added they wanted to make it clear the Bailiwick stands with Ukraine. Deputy Peter Ferbrache President of the Policy and Resources Committee said Guernsey had taken steps in line with the UK to support Ukraine. He said: These include the quick implementation of sanctions against Russia and financial support for aid agencies supporting the Ukrainian people. But supporting these propositions through our parliamentary process is another important way we can make very clear that the Bailiwick stands with Ukraine and is firmly opposed to the Russian Federation\s invasion. He added: There is no justification for the horrific violence being inflicted upon innocent Ukrainian men women and children. History will remember what is happening now as it will remember the heroic efforts being made by the people of Ukraine to defend their home. Follow BBC Guernsey on Twitter and Facebook.

Ukraine war: WHO says attacks on health facilities are rising daily,The World Health Organization has verified more than 70 attacks on hospitals and healthcare facilities.,Ukraine war: WHO says attacks on health facilities are rising daily By Jim Reed Health reporter Published 26 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE VOLODYMYR MATSOKIN Image caption The central hospital in Izyum near Kharkiv after what Ukrainian authorities say was a Russian artillery attack There have been more than 70 separate attacks on hospitals ambulances and doctors in Ukraine with the number increasing on a daily basis says the World Health Organization (WHO). It says the targeting of healthcare facilities has become part of the strategy and tactics of modern warfare. A recent casualty on 8 March was the newly refurbished central hospital in Izyum south of Kharkiv. It was hit by what the Ukrainian authorities said were Russian shells. Video and photos posted online by the citys deputy mayor showed extensive damage to the main hospital building. A new reception area built last year was completely destroyed. The footage has been verified by the BBC and other media outlets although the exact circumstances of the attack are impossible to establish at this time. After the first bombing the windows of the hospital blew out the deputy mayor Volodymyr Matsokin told the BBC. A second attack destroyed the hospitals operating rooms he added. Ukraine: The doctors racing aid from the UK to the front line Oxygen stocks running dangerously low in Ukraine Ukraine war: The road to safety for Ukraines cancer children That day hospital staff were treating children pregnant women and three newborn babies as well as soldiers and civilians injured in fierce fighting in the region according to the Ukrainian authorities. They were sheltering in the basement at the time of the attack and no-one was killed. The government had invested millions to provide good facilities with modern equipment said Mr Matsokin. Patients had to climb out of the rubble on their own to escape. The BBC has contacted the Russian embassy in London about the attack but has received no response although in the past Moscow has denied deliberately targeting civilians. Since 24 February the WHO has reviewed and verified 72 separate attacks on healthcare facilities in Ukraine causing at least 71 deaths and 37 injuries. IMAGE SOURCE GOOGLE (L) AND VOLODYMR MATSOKIN (R) Image caption The central hospital in Izyum in August 2021 and after an attack on 8 March 2022 Most have damaged hospitals medical transports and supply stores but the WHO has also recorded the probable abduction or detention of healthcare staff and patients. We are concerned that this number is increasing daily the WHO\s Ukraine country representative Jarno Habicht told the BBC. Health facilities should be safe places for both doctors and nurses but also patients to turn to for treatment. This should not happen. Because the war in Ukraine is an international armed conflict between two states the Geneva Conventions apply. Expanded in the aftermath of World War Two the conventions set out the basic rights of civilians and military personnel and establish protection for the wounded and sick. They were ratified by what was then the Soviet Union in 1954. War in Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby WATCH: Destruction of Ukraines cities from above ZELENSKY: How Ukraines leader tailors his addresses READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Under Article 18 of the Conventions civilian hospitals may in no circumstances be the object of attack but shall at all times be respected and protected. A breach of that rule can be investigated by the International Criminal Court in the Hague and if found to be a war crime individual perpetrators can be prosecuted and punished. There are though exemptions to the Conventions. The protection from attack is lost if the medical facility is placed near a legitimate military target or is thought to be committing an act harmful to the enemy. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) that could include the use of a hospital as a shield for healthy fighters or the staging of a medical unit in a position which impedes an enemy attack. IMAGE SOURCE SERGEI ORLOV Image caption Aftermath of a Russian air strike on a maternity and children’s hospital in Mariupol Neve Gordon professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University of London said: What we have today in effect is a situation where hospitals and medical units have become fair game. If there are soldiers outside the hospital or it is simply next to a train station it can be attacked. Or it could be that a wounded soldier has a cellphone and is calling other troops and telling them that there is someone nearby. All these loopholes render it possible to claim the attack was legitimate. The ICRC says that in theory before targeting a hospital which might be in breach of those rules the attacking side should always give a warning with a time limit and the other side must have ignored that warning. There is no evidence this has happened in the Ukraine conflict. Prof Gordon would like to see a far stronger blanket ban on any attack on medical facilities under international law similar to the ban on torture adopted by the United Nations which came into force in 1987. From Vietnam to Syria Exemptions to the Geneva Conventions have been used to justify attacks on hospitals and medical units in post-World War Two conflicts from Korea and Vietnam onwards. The trend though appears to be accelerating rapidly driven in part by the use of ballistic missiles drones and other longer range munitions. The US advocacy group Physicians for Human Rights claims that Russian or local forces have been linked to at least 244 separate attacks on healthcare facilities in Syria since 2011. At one point the charity Médecins Sans Frontières even made the decision to stop sharing the GPS co-ordinates of some health clinics it operated with the Syrian government or its Russian allies amid concerns they were more likely to become direct targets as a result. Russian officials denied deliberately attacking hospitals in Syria and suggested jihadists in the country were routinely sheltering in protected civilian buildings. IMAGE SOURCE LUHANSK REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION Image caption A photograph released on 18 March by Ukrainian authorities showing a hospital damaged by shelling in Sievierodonetsk The WHO is concerned that all this means attacks on medical facilities are fast becoming part of the wider strategy and tactics of modern warfare regardless of the Geneva Conventions rules. Destroying health facilities it warned is about the destruction of hope and the denial of basic human rights. We\ve never seen globally... this rate of attacks on healthcare its emergencies director Michael Ryan told a news conference this week. This crisis is reaching a point where the health system in Ukraine is teetering on the brink. It needs to be supported… but how can you do that if the very infrastructure that those people will go in to support is under direct attack? You can follow Jim on Twitter.

Ukraine daily round-up: Russia says first phase over as Biden visits Poland,"Russia says it will focus on the east, Biden meets US troops and Putin cites JK Rowling in a speech.",Ukraine daily round-up: Russia says first phase over as Biden visits Poland Published 25 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE AFP Image caption The Russian army says 1351 of its soldiers have been killed in the war so far but Ukraine says the number is higher One month after Russias invasion began its military is declaring the wars first phase over. Moscow said its initial aim was to destroy most of Ukraines air force and navy but its invasion has stalled and Kyiv is still in Ukrainian hands. Its efforts are now turning to the eastern Donbas region a senior military official said on Friday. So is this a step back? Or a tactical ploy? Western officials and analysts are divided. The announcement came on a day of developments elsewhere - heres the latest. Moscow says phase one is over Russian officials are claiming its army has accomplished its initial goals and will now focus on the complete liberation of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine. That part of the country contains two pro-Russian breakaway republics - Donetsk and Luhansk. Its too soon to tell if this represents a downgrading of the Kremlins ultimate ambitions but its definitely a change in emphasis. Russia could now concentrate its military offensives fully in Ukraines east. Read the full analysis from our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams. Biden meets troops in Poland IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption The US has sent around 12000 more troops to Europe since February US President Joe Biden visited troops at an American base in Poland near the border with Ukraine. He told them their deployment was part of the global struggle for democracy. You are the finest fighting force in the history of the world the president told the soldiers. What you\re doing is consequential. The stop at an airbase in Rzeszow was part of Mr Bidens three-day tour around Europe to rally allies. Fear in Ukraines south On the ground in Ukraine residents around the country are continuing to live in fear of Russian attacks. But some people - from a broad mix of backgrounds - have taken up arms. On the road into Mariupol 62-year-old Sergei is stationed at one of the last Ukrainian military checkpoints before the nearby front. I used to work as fire engine driver then I took up arms to protect my homeland he told the BBC\s Wyre Davies. We know what\s happening in Mariupol] and we must not let that happen here. The soldiers Sergei is with have no idea what Russia will do next but they are prepared with supplies and weapons. Inside a battle near the capital The town of Irpin is just a 20-minute drive north-west of the Ukrainian capital and it lies in ruins. Few buildings have escaped the damage inflicted by weeks of bombardment from the sky. I\m bad says an older man whose house has been destroyed by a shell. Children are dying everyone is dying.

Will Ukraine invasion push Japan to go nuclear?,Ex-PM Shinzo Abe shocked Japan by saying it should think about nuclear weapons - but he's not alone.,Will Ukraine invasion push Japan to go nuclear? By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes BBC News Tokyo Published 26 March Share Related Topics World War Two IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Former Japan PM Shinzo Abe has shocked Japan by saying it should think about nuclear weapons How could Japan ever contemplate getting nukes? Its a ridiculous idea. Japan is the only country in the world to have suffered a nuclear attack. Twice. Japan acquiring nuclear weapons is unthinkable. The people would never accept it. Right? Right. Or so the story has gone for the last 77 years. But in the last few weeks one Japanese politician has started suggesting otherwise. He is Shinzo Abe Japans longest serving post-war prime minister. Mr Abe has begun saying loudly and publicly that Japan should indeed think seriously and urgently about nuclear weapons. What we are talking about here is a fundamental break with Japans post-war commitment to pacifism - something enshrined in its post-war constitution. But its no coincidence this call-to-arms has come just as Russia has invaded Ukraine. For those like Mr Abe who have long yearned for a fully re-armed Japan the invasion of Ukraine serves as a useful example of what can happen to countries that dont defend themselves properly against bigger better armed and more aggressive neighbours. Richard McGregor of the Lowy Institute in Sydney and author of Asias Reckoning believes Abe thinks the time is right to push genuine debate in Japan and get on to the serious work of really trying to persuade the Japanese public. Women survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs I think that\s the holy grail here. I think he wants to try and move public opinion which has been frankly pretty stubborn he told the BBC. Pretty stubborn is an understatement. A survey conducted last year found 75% of Japanese want the country to sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Mr Abe\s call for a nuclear debate was met with outrage from atom bomb survivors\ groups in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Current Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (who is from Hiroshima) was quick to slap down his predecessor calling Mr Abe\s suggestion unacceptable. But Mr Abe is an astute politician. He knows Ukraine has come as a huge shock and he knows the Japanese public is worried about an unpredictable nuclear-armed North Korea and an increasingly aggressive China. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Japan\s current prime minister Fumio Kishida has called Mr Abe\s suggestion unacceptable Professor Yoichi Shimada is a conservative academic and long-time friend and advisor to Shinzo Abe. He thinks it\s imperative for Japan to have some kind of independent attacking power against China or North Korea Professor Shimada says. And that includes possibly a nuclear arsenal. But he also knows it would be suicidal for any politician to advocate for Japan to have nuclear weapons so he wants to activate the debate. The official position of the Japanese government now is to rely on US extended (nuclear) deterrents. But Japan doesn\t allow the United States to deploy nuclear weapons in Japan. That frankly is selfish. And so Mr Abe is not suggesting Japan build its own nuclear weapons. Hes suggesting it borrow some from America. Reality Check: Where are the worlds nuclear weapons? Largely forgotten in the post-cold war world is the fact is that Germany Belgium Italy and the Netherlands all store US nuclear weapons on their soil. More than that if there were a nuclear war these non-nuclear weapons states could deliver those weapons to targets on behalf of the US using their own aircraft. This is what Mr Abe is now proposing for Japan. It all still feels very far-fetched. Japanese law has explicitly banned any nuclear weapons from its soil since 1971. But Mr Abe is not alone in calling for that ban to now be debated. Ryozo Kato was Japans longest serving post-war ambassador to the United States and is perhaps the most ardent advocate of the Japan-US alliance. But he says with a nuclear-armed North Korea Japan can no longer just to rely on the US nuclear umbrella. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption North Korea has been ramping up its nuclear testing and long-range missile capabilities It may not be China he says. Some crazy leader may decide to fire nuclear weapons at Japan. Or they could use them for political intimidation. Japan is quite vulnerable to intimidation. We have to do more in defence terms. Japans pacifism was foisted on it by the American occupiers after World War II. Junking this has always seemed far-fetched. But its something both the US government and much of Japans political elite now support. Many Americans wish they hadn\t bound Japan with the peace constitution says Richard McGregor of the Lowy Institute. We shouldn\t forget that people like Abe also deeply resent the Americans imposing this constitution on them. They obviously bottled up their annoyance because they want the alliance with America. They know they can\t handle China on their own. There is a kind of seller\s remorse and buyer\s remorse on the peace constitution on both sides of the Pacific. In fact Japan is already far from being a true pacifist state whatever its constitution proclaims. Its navy is now amongst the most powerful in the world - quite a bit larger than Britains Royal Navy. What Japan lacks is long-range strike capability. Prof Yoichi Shimada says the consensus is that must now change. The position that Japan should have weapons which can hit the enemy territory I think that in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party the vast majority of the politicians thinks it\s necessary for Japan to have such capability. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Professor Shimada says the possibility of Russia waging nuclear war on Ukraine has spooked Japanese politicians Prof Shimada says Vladimir Putins threats against Ukraine have only made that more urgent. Would Putin press the nuclear button? President Putin actually referred to the use of nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear state. That amounts to a game changer for many politicians in Japan. Russia is one of the permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations. We all know that Putin is brutal. But it is very shocking even for him. Unlike Ukraine Japan has a full alliance with the United States and a commitment from Washington to retaliate against any country that attacks Japan including with nuclear weapons. That has worked while America has reigned supreme. But in Asia China is now rapidly approaching military parity with America. And then came the election of Donald Trump. Mr Trump said that you have to do your own security says Hiromi Murakami author of The Abe Legacy. He said it explicitly. But I think the overall trend of US is basically the same as Mr Trump. You can\t totally rely on the US anymore. For some like Ambassador Kato the answer is to strengthen the US-Japan alliance - and for Japan to take on more of the burden of defending its own neighbourhood. For Prof Shimada it could mean one day Japan will have to develop its own nuclear deterrent. One thing everyone I spoke to agreed is that Japan must somehow get over the taboo of talking about its own defence. This has been avoided for many many years. says Ms Murakami. But the Japanese leadership really needs to bring this to the table and show it to the public. We can\t live in this fake world any longer. This Ukraine situation is really shocking and I hope that it will trigger the leadership and the general public to really think.]

It said it needs further assistance to make links through the Foreign Offices contacts in the region. Refugees need people in the UK willing to sponsor them as part of their visa application. Visits to sponsors homes will begin on Monday the Executive Office confirmed. The Homes for Ukraine scheme has been criticised for being slow and difficult to find matches. Therese Gorman in Lisburn has been trying to find a refugee to sponsor. She told BBC Radio Ulster\s Evening Extra programme it had been a minefield.

Homes for Ukraine: Its sad slow and frustrating Where have Ukraines 10 million refugees gone? And I\m here with this big empty house wanting to help and it\s very frustrating I can\t move this any way forward without some sort of government help. I\ve just got nowhere. I\ve tried so hard. Where other countries seem to be saying come on ahead no visas no hassle no anything just come ours seems to be fraught with difficulty it\s just a mine field and it\s taken hours and hours and actually I haven\t made any contact with anybody. Process may not work for everyone An Executive Office spokesperson said: We have raised with the UK government the need for them to provide further assistance in making links through the contacts that the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office has in Ukraine and the surrounding region. They said the matching process may not work for everyone. Anyone who has registered an interest in providing accommodation for a refugee under the Homes for Ukraine scheme and does not know a Ukrainian person or family to sponsor is encouraged to make contact with local community or faith based organisations to help facilitate the matching process. Ukrainian refugees allowed to bring pets Anyone who is not able to find a match under the Homes for Ukraine Scheme will have further opportunities to provide support to a refugee when other schemes are developed as part of the ongoing humanitarian effort. The visa required to travel here under the Homes for Ukraine Scheme is subject to satisfactory checks carried out by the Home Office on both the sponsor and refugee. The executive office added they have put arrangements in place for home visits to take place from Monday.]

The heavy losses of an elite Russian regiment in Ukraine,"The 331st Guards Parachute Regiment based in Kostroma, Russia, has lost many soldiers in Ukraine.",The heavy losses of an elite Russian regiment in Ukraine By Mark Urban Diplomatic and defence editor Newsnight Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption Some of the 39 Russian soldiers from the 331st regiment who are known to have died In any war there are units that distinguish themselves and others that become symbolic of failure. The 331st Guards Parachute Regiment had high hopes of being the first but now represents the disintegration of Russias plan for a quick war. The regiment\s commanding officer Col Sergei Sukharev was killed in Ukraine on 13 March and was posthumously awarded the Hero of the Russian Federation medal. At his funeral deputy defence minister Gen Yuri Sadovenko said the colonel lived for the future for the future of our people a future without Nazism. IMAGE SOURCE GTRK-KOSTROMA Image caption Col Sergei Sukharev commander of the Kostroma 331st regiment was also killed Casualties among Russian forces are not widely reported in Russia itself but using open source material the BBC has pieced together the story of their advance and found that at least 39 other members of the elite 331st regiment have died. The men were part of a column that advanced into Ukraine from Belarus led by Russias airborne forces known by the acronym VDV. Their presence underlined the priority of their objective - advancing on the capital Kyiv. That advance swiftly got drawn into a destructive stalemate in districts on the outskirts of Kyiv which soon became synonymous with the viciousness of the war: Bucha Irpin and Hostomel. Videos that emerged online from these battles showed combat vehicles used by Russian airborne forces with V signs painted onto them. IMAGE SOURCE TWITTER One video we found shows several damaged light armoured vehicles from the VDV abandoned after an attack by Ukrainian special forces. Another shows several vehicles from the Russian airborne forces apparently abandoned. The men in the 331st regarded themselves as the pick of Russia\s army. In a video posted online last May a general tells soldiers of the 331st Parachute Regiment that they are the best of the best. The unit served in the Balkans Chechnya and the 2014 Russian intervention in the Donbas region of Ukraine and regularly took part in Red Square parades in Moscow. The 331st was also a showcase for Russias policy of replacing national service soldiers with contraktniki - professionals under contract. It is understandable why the generals should have given it an important role in the invasion. IMAGE SOURCE VK.COM Image caption A comment on a post mourning Maj Sergei Krylov reads: We are proud of you thank you for supporting peace. Russian hero Major Krylov. RIP - this post is no longer public From early March reports began to circulate of deaths in the 331st. It took time for bodies to be returned to Kostroma the community where it is based 300km north-east of Moscow. As the funerals started an anguished conversation began playing out on social media. Memorial walls on V\Kontakte - the Russian equivalent of Facebook - pledge eternal memory and feature pictures of candles. IMAGE SOURCE VK.COM Image caption The wife of Sergei Lobachyov mourns her reliable loving and caring husband A woman who says she was the wife of Warrant Officer Sergei Lobachyov writes: Seryozha my most reliable loving and caring husband. Now you are in heaven and you will protect us from there! You will always live in our hearts and you will forever be a real hero to me! Although many posts appear to accept Kremlin explanations that the war is being waged against Ukrainian fascists some also display anxiety about the lack of reliable information. IMAGE SOURCE VK.COM Image caption A post mourning Sergey Duganov On the memorial wall for Sergeant Sergei Duganov one woman wrote: Nobody knows anything. The 331st regiment is disappearing. Almost every day photos of our Kostroma boys get published. It sends shivers down my spine. What\s happening? When will this end? When will people stop dying? Her post was followed by another which exclaimed: Kostroma has lost so many young men what a tragedy. Another pleaded: God how many more death notifications shall we receive? Please have mercy on our boys help them survive return them back home to their wives and mothers. I\m begging you! IMAGE SOURCE VK.COM Image caption Yanosh Leonovs partner writes: You are a real hero you are the best father a loved and loving husband a loyal friend and a real fighter. Speaking out about the war in Russia carries great risks but there are hints of a loss of faith in the Kremlin\s arguments for war. On the memorial page for one sergeant a woman asks: Why aren\t children of MPs not on the frontline? The majority of them live in Europe anyway. Ordinary boys are dying for no good reason. Another uses an expletive to describe President Vladimir Putin and goes on to say that by deciding to play war he has sent thousands of guys to die. For the most part though those reacting on social media remain true to the official narrative. IMAGE SOURCE INSTAGRAM Image caption The top Ukrainian comment on a post mourning Ravshan Zhakbayev reads: Everyone who steps on our soil to occupy it will get buried in it. Welcome to hell! A later comment reads: Eternal memory to you our hero our protector. Thanks for all.((( On some V\Kontakte memorial walls Ukrainians have posted comments mocking the dead men. Over 15000 have died already and they will continue on dying as long as they\ll keep on marching on our land. Nobody invited you freaking saviours reads one. Alexander go away you bloody Nazi a Russian responds to another mocking post. Our soldiers are real heroes. Russians have never killed civilians nor children which is something you can\t say about Ukrainians. The fury of those online exchanges is nothing though to the experiences of the VDV forces who have been hit by Ukrainian artillery ambushes and infantry assaults during weeks of bloody combat. In these close-quarter battles they have discovered what earlier VDV units learned in Afghanistan - that armoured vehicles designed to be light enough to be carried on planes do not give much protection from enemy fire. From the roads outside Hostomel airfield to a side street in Bucha or a road junction in Irpin videos taken by Ukrainians have shown burnt out and abandoned vehicles belonging to the airborne group.

View original tweet on Twitter These scraps of phone footage also speak to a more basic failure. In these shattered neighbourhoods around Kyiv the Russian paratroopers were outmatched by the Ukrainians. And given that the defenders were in many cases simply local defence units or reservists that speaks to a basic failure in the VDVs system of training and recruitment. Ukrainians have latched on to the 331st\s losses making excited claims that the regiment has been wiped out. Ilya Ponamarev a former Russian MP and opposition figure who now lives in Kyiv says people there see the regiment\s fate as a perfect example of karma. During the 2014 fighting in the Donbas the 331st was held responsible by Ukrainians for killing hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers at Ilovaisk in breach of a ceasefire agreement. However while the regiment has suffered considerably Ukrainian claims that they have been wiped out are an exaggeration. It is likely though that the 331st Parachute Regiment may have been withdrawn from Ukraine recently - certainly unidentified elements of the VDV task force to which it belonged were filmed on 29 March pulling back into Belarus. Image caption Photographs of some of the Russian soldiers from the 331 regiment who have died As for the price of failure it mounts daily. At the time of writing BBC Newsnight had compiled a list of 39 named members of the 331st Parachute Regiment killed in Ukraine. But since none of those fatalities is more recent than the 13 March it can be supposed that dozens more will emerge in the coming weeks. Kostroma locals have told us they believe that around 100 members of the regiment may have died. And many families will never receive their loved ones body because it was left behind on the battlefield. Even a conservative projection of the deaths we now know about and their dates suggest that the towns losses in a few weeks in Ukraine already exceed those from the conflicts in Afghanistan and Chechnya. The regiment that set off full of confidence in February has acquired the type of reputation that no soldiers would ever want.

Ukraine round-up: Possible war crimes and an attack on Russia,"Day 37 saw Russia accuse Ukraine of bombing an oil facility on its territory, and the BBC witnessed possible evidence of war crimes.",Ukraine round-up: Possible war crimes and an attack on Russia Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Media caption Watch: Jeremy Bowen finds bodies on a road Russians occupied outside Kyiv As Russia pulls its forces back from areas around Ukraines capital Kyiv the BBC has seen evidence of potential war crimes on the outskirts of the city. Our correspondent Jeremy Bowen counted 13 bodies on one small stretch of highway where just hours earlier Russian forces had been in control. We know who two of the dead were: a Ukrainian father and mother who had been fleeing to the capital with their daughter and an elderly woman. We know this because their deaths - as he put his hands up in surrender trying desperately to stop Russian forces firing on the car they were travelling in - were caught on camera by a drone. In other places along the road attempts had been made to cover up the bodies. Our correspondent says we dont know what happened to these people but a credible working assumption for any investigation must be that the other dead people were killed by either the tank crew seen in the drone video or other Russian soldiers. The drone footage has been handed to the authorities for investigation. There have been numerous allegations of war crimes made since the start of the invasion in February and both the UN and the International Criminal Court are looking into them. Read Jeremy Bowens full report into what he and his team found here Russia accuses Ukraine of striking oil depot on its territory IMAGE SOURCE RUSSIAN EMERGENCIES MINISTRY/REUTERS Image caption Several fuel tanks are ablaze Russian media report Russia accused Ukraine of being responsible for a huge fire at an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod. Russian officials said two Ukrainian military helicopters had crossed the border from Ukraine and fired missiles at the facility. Vyacheslav Gladkov governor of the Russian city of Belgorod some 40km (25 miles) from the border said the early morning rocket attack left eight fuel tanks ablaze. Initial statements from Ukraine would neither confirm nor deny that - but later in the day the secretary of Ukraine\s security council Oleksiy Danilov said the Russian version of events does not correspond to reality. But if it is true that Ukraine mounted the attack our defence correspondent Jonathan Beale notes it would mark the first time that Ukrainian aircraft have flown into Russian airspace to hit a target bringing the war home to Russia. And it isnt impossible: the skills needed - flying low and fast to avoid detection - are ones Ukrainian pilots have been honing in recent years as the country battled separatists in the east.

Evacuation team fails to reach Mariupol IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS A Red Cross team which had hoped to make it to the besieged city of Mariupol to help with an evacuation effort was forced to turn back after arrangements and conditions made it impossible to proceed. The team of nine from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had been hoping to help evacuate some of the thousands of residents still trapped in the coastal city large parts of which have been destroyed in the fighting. The regional governor has accused Russia of breaking a promise to allow a humanitarian corridor out of Mariupol. The ICRC said it will try again on Saturday. It had initially been planned for Thursday. Whats happening in the east? Moscow has begun shifting its attention from the capital and the north in general trying instead to encircle Ukraines forces in the east of the country. Its army is moving south taking control of the city of Izyum and bombarding a succession of towns to the east. Eventually it hopes to move further south still to the town of Slovyansk. But what is it that Russia wants with this region known as the Donbas? On paper at least the aim is to liberate its Russian-speaking majority. The question remains: can Moscows forces defeat the Ukrainian army here and - crucially - do the people of this former coal and steel-producing region want to be liberated? As the BBCs Paul Kirby has been finding out a shared language may not be enough to win the regions loyalty.

Ukraine: Russia praises India for not judging war in 'one-sided way',India has offered support to Russia over Ukraine but is under pressure from other countries.,Ukraine: Russia praises India for not judging war in one-sided way Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption Sergei Lavrov (L) met S Jaishankar in Delhi Russia has praised India for not judging the conflict in Ukraine in a one-sided way as foreign ministers from both countries met in Delhi. India has not joined the widespread condemnation of Russias invasion and is a major buyer of Russian arms. But it faces a diplomatic balancing act and is under pressure from Western countries to help rein in Russia. Following the talks India said it favoured peaceful resolutions of conflicts but did not criticise Russia. India which is a nuclear power has a long history of pursuing a non-aligned strategy in international politics not tying itself to the interests of other superpowers or political blocs. Russia\s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov - who also met Indian\s Prime Minister Narendra Modi - spoke of the friendship between the two nations in his statement. These days our Western colleagues would like to reduce any meaningful international issue to the crisis in Ukraine he said. We] appreciate that India is taking this situation in the entirety of facts not just in a one-sided way. Russia has justified invading Ukraine as a means to demilitarise and de-Nazify its neighbour an argument widely dismissed by the West as a baseless pretext for invasion. Mr Lavrov\s Indian counterpart S Jaishankar emphasised the importance of cessation of violence and ending hostilities. Differences and disputes should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy and by respect for international law the] UN Charter sovereignty and territorial integrity of states India\s foreign ministry said.

FUEL: Could the world cope without Russian oil? READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis India needs Russian military hardware as deterrence against China with which it was involved in a deadly border clash with in 2020. China too has stopped short of condemning Russias actions in Ukraine. The US chief sanctions strategist Daleep Singh alluded to Russia-China ties when he warned India that Russia would not be a reliable ally ahead of the foreign ministers meeting. Russia is going to be the junior partner in this relationship with China. And the more leverage that China gains over Russia the less favourable that is for India he said. India stepped up purchases of Russia oil after prices slumped in the wake of Western sanctions. On Thursday UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she respected India\s decision to continue to buy oil but also urged like-minded nations to co-operate more closely on defence trade and energy and food security. In recent weeks theres been a conveyor belt of visiting dignitaries and diplomats whove come to India from the UK US China Japan Germany Austria Mexico Nepal and Greece. It seems as if every nation wants to get India on side - but India is resolutely staying neutral. Delhi prides itself on its independent foreign policy yet its ties with Russia run deep and are also practical - it buys the vast majority of its weapons from Moscow. The visit by Russias Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was a clear signal that India still sees Russia as an ally even if many world leaders view it as an aggressor. Prime Minister Modi even took time to meet Sergei Lavrov himself - contrast that to British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Chinas Foreign Minister Wang Yi both recent visitors who didnt get an audience. Indias relationship with Russia and its diplomatic balancing act could turn it into an unexpected broker. Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was open to India mediating in the crisis while a statement from Prime Minister Modis office said hed conveyed Indias readiness to contribute in any way to the peace efforts.]
Why Russia is trying to encircle Ukraine's east,"Russia has shifted most of the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine, aiming to ""liberate"" the region.",Why Russia is trying to encircle Ukraines east By Paul Kirby BBC News Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Russian troops now control large areas of the east but Ukraine has vowed to fight for every last metre Russia has shifted most of the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine after a series of setbacks especially around the capital Kyiv. This push into the area known as Donbas could signal a more prolonged conflict says the US. What would Vladimir Putin need before he could claim his goal of liberating Ukraine\s old industrial heart and is that possible? Russian forces have already triggered a humanitarian catastrophe in the east reducing Mariupol to ruins but they have failed to inflict defeat on Ukraine\s military. Warning of a new onslaught on the east President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed: We will fight for every metre of our land. Ukraine had already stationed its best-trained forces in the east because of an eight-year war with Russian-backed separatists. They are thought to have suffered heavy losses but are still a significant challenge to Russias invading army. What is Ukraines Donbas? When President Putin talks of Donbas he is referring to Ukraines old coal and steel-producing area. But he really means the entirety of two big eastern regions Luhansk and Donetsk which run from outside Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border. The key is that it has been identified by the Kremlin as a Russian-speaking part of Ukraine that is more Russia than Ukraine says Sam Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute. These areas may be broadly Russian-speaking but they are no longer pro-Russian. Mariupol was one of the most pro-Russian cities in Ukraine and to level it is beyond my comprehension says defence specialist Konrad Muzyka head of Rochan Consulting. Last week Russia claimed to have taken control of 93% of Luhansk region and 54% of Donetsk. Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukraines army in the east. They have taken control of Izyum - a strategic town on the road between Ukraines second city Kharkiv and the separatist areas - and have bombarded a succession of Luhansk towns including Rubizhne Lysychansk Popasna and Severodonetsk destroying blocks of flats and killing civilians in their homes. The towns that are now in Russian sights have already experienced years of war since 2014 and barely a day goes by now without a deadly attack. Civilians are being moved out ahead of the Russian advance. Local leader Serhiy Haidai said 20 children were led to safety from the basement of a kindergarten in Lysychansk on Thursday and some 200 civilians climbed on to buses in Severodonetsk. IMAGE SOURCE SERHIY HAIDAI/LUHANSK OVA Image caption More than 200 people were evacuated from Severodonetsk on Thursday They were leaving for western Ukraine with nothing said Mr Haidai but they were alive. Maryna Agafonova 27 fled her family\s home in Lysychansk earlier this week. At the start of the war she said Russian forces had targeted the outskirts of the town but had lately hit the centre. They attacked hospitals and residential buildings. There is no heating and no electricity. My parents are still there. Ukrainian forces were still holding out there in numbers she told the BBC: They don\t let the Russians occupy it. Russias next aim will be to push south to encircle Slovyansk a city of 125000 people that already experienced war at close hand when it was seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014 before being recaptured. War in Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine WAR CRIMES: Gruesome evidence on road to Kyiv YOUR QUESTIONS: Could Ukraine win the war? FUEL: Could the world cope without Russian oil? READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Why Putin wants to control Donbas The Russian leader has repeatedly made the unfounded accusation that Ukraine has carried out genocide in the east. When the war began two-thirds of the eastern regions were in Ukrainian hands. The rest was run by separatists who created Russian-backed statelets during a war that began eight years ago. If Russia were to conquer both big regions then the next step could be to annexe them too just like it did with Crimea in 2014. Before invading Ukraine President Putin recognised the entirety of the two eastern regions as independent of Ukraine. The Russian puppet leader in Luhansk has already spoken of a referendum in the near future although the idea of even a sham vote taking place in a war zone seems absurd. Scary existence in separatist Luhansk Life under the control of Russian-backed separatists is quieter although separatist authorities have accused Ukrainian forces of shelling residential buildings and killing civilians. Officials in the Donetsk statelet say 72 civilians have died since mid-February. One woman in Luhansk told the BBC on condition of anonymity that she had seen a lot of Russian military armour in the city and the atmosphere now was one of fear and caution. I\m scared - it\s just scary she said. Men of military age were required to join the local militia so anyone who avoided the draft was in hiding she explained. They\re mobilising men] on the streets catching them. There are no men in the shops in town on the streets. As a result all male-dominated businesses are shut she said. We\re already Russia although just informally. Everyone has a Russian passport. Will Ukraines forces hold out? At the start of the war the 10 brigades that made up the Joint Forces Operation (JFO) in the east were regarded as the best-equipped and best-trained soldiers that Ukraine has. We don\t really know the strength of Ukrainian forces now said Sam Cranny-Evans of Rusi who believes their numbers will have been boosted by volunteers in recent weeks. Russian forces have already sustained high losses after more than five weeks of conflict and morale is thought to be low. They are made up of men enlisted from the local separatist areas as well as the broader Russian army. However they have seized a considerable part of the south-east and will hope to control the entire stretch of coastal territory from Crimea to the Russian border. The main goal for the Ukrainians is to incur as big losses on the Russian side as possible and the Ukrainians are using asymmetric tactics to avoid big battles says Konrad Muzyka. One man called Mykyta who managed to flee the Russian bombardment of Mariupol said he was confident the Ukrainian army would succeed in fighting back. Some day they will return our cities the Azov battalion will not surrender Mariupol he told the BBC. The Ukrainian army is very cunning I didn\t see them in my city but I heard them they are very good at disguise.]
Ukraine war: Polish doctor saves family's sight after bombing,The mother of five-year-old twin boys describes how she tried to protect as their house was bombed.,Ukraine war: Polish doctor saves familys sight after bombing By Kasia Madera BBC News Lublin Poland Published 2 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war I went into the kitchen and saw a bomb coming towards my window. It was all so quick I didn\t know what was happening. I just saw it flying towards me. It was the morning of 11 March in the eastern Ukrainian region of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast when a bomb crashed into Olena Selichzianowas home - and her family. Speaking in Russian the mother of five-year-old twin boys Nazar and Timur describes how she fell to her knees pulling her sons beneath her to protect them from the pieces of shrapnel. After the bombs impact she recalls nothing. All three were blinded by the flying fragments that cut into their arms and faces. Their skin was badly burned a small shard of glass embedded itself in one of Olenas eyes and her leg was broken. Image caption Nazar and Timur have had several surgeries to try to save their sight The family were pulled from the wreckage and taken to a nearby hospital but their wounds were so serious they had to be moved quickly. In Lviv eye specialist Dr Nataliya Preys was made aware of this familys injuries. Dr Preys sent images of the wounds to her former teacher in Poland Professor Robert Rejdak at the Medical University of Lublin. He knew the three needed to be treated immediately. But the fighting in Ukraine meant it would take a week for Olena Nazar and Timur to reach Poland. A little bit of a miracle They have come from hell Professor Rejdak told us. The mum was completely blind she could only reach out to touch her children. The children were so hungry and tired when they first arrived that they only ate slept and cried. He is visibly moved as he recounts their first meeting. Then his expertise as a leading surgeon at one of Europes largest eye hospitals takes over. We decided to operate on mum. I performed bilateral cataract surgery. The surgery was really complicated because of the wounds because of a piece of glass inside one eye. Fortunately the surgery went really perfectly and Olena sees almost fully two days after. The healing process is perfect so I hope it will be even better - but at least now she can see her boys and look around. A journey out of Ukraine in real time Familys bid to reach safety ends in tragedy The little boys journey to health will take longer. Nazar has lost his eye. Professor Rejdaks team performed retina surgery and is now planning further cataract surgery. The twins also have really massive ocular trauma he says. We are hoping the vision will be good but they need longer treatment. If Olena and her boys had reached Lublin just a few days later the consequences would have been stark. They would be blind because it was the last moment to start the treatment it already took seven days from the accident and in ocular trauma time is crucial. When asked if it was a miracle to be able to save their sight Professor Rejdak says a little bit. Jumpy and struggling to sleep Back on the ward the little boys are playing. Although it is Nazar who has lost his eye he seems more protective over his brother Timur who is a little shyer and more withdrawn. A psychologist is helping them giving them tablets so they can sleep explains Olena. They are feeling better and have had many operations. But they saw the bomb fall on them. They are a little calmer but they are jumpy and they struggle to sleep. Before the war Olena was a cook at the local school. Once her family have healed would she want to go back? No she answers quickly. Everyone has been so kind here I want to stay. Also my home has been destroyed there is nothing left. Professor Rejdak is among those helping to find somewhere for this family to live. Once Olena has recovered and only when she is ready the hope is she that she will find a job. This is not the only family that needs help. Professor Rejdak is providing virtual consultations with his colleagues in Ukraine. Thanks to his teaching work he has a network of specialists. He works closely with his former pupil Dr Preys and advises who should be evacuated to receive surgery in Lublin.

"Ukraine: UK visa process dehumanising, says relative",A woman helping her family to the UK criticises the bureacracy involved in the Ukraine Family Scheme.,Ukraine: UK visa process dehumanising says relative Published 1 day ago Share IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption Emily Radford is helping the cousin of her Ukrainian wife come to the UK The British wife of a Ukrainian woman has said the visa process for family members fleeing the war is dehumanising. Emily Radford said her partner a British citizen had gone to Poland to bring her cousins family to Sheffield. But she said the three-week visa process had been insane and needlessly bureacratic. The government said it had streamlined the scheme but security checks were vital. Under the Ukraine Family Scheme those fleeing the war are eligible for a UK visa if they are joining a family member based in the country. Ms Radford 39 has been helping the group - which includes four children aged 17. 12 eight and four with the application from home. Gruesome evidence points to war crimes on road to Kyiv How do Russians get news about the war in Ukraine? Could Ukraine win the war? And other questions After a long wait their visas were approved on Wednesday but Ms Radford was critical of the process. She was particularly upset that child applicants had to answer questions about terrorist affiliations and military history. They\ve treated what are primarily women and children as threats first rather than people to help she said. That\s not to say that if it was men it would be different - maybe it would maybe it wouldn\t. But it\s women and kids... I had to answer for a four-year-old: \Are you a terrorist? Have you ever been in the armed forces?\ Why are you asking those questions? It should literally just be: \Are you a child? Who is your mum? OK we\ll sort you out when you\re here and we can have questions with you then if we need to.\ IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption The 39-year-old hoped the family would fly to the UK on Friday Ms Radford said her wife whose name she asked to be withheld found the British visa application difficult. She said that the Polish people have been wonderful but as soon as she interacted with British bureaucracy she felt terrible which is really hard for me to hear as a British person Ms Radford said. She hopes her Ukrainian relatives will be able to fly to the UK on later to join she and her wife in Sheffield. A government spokesperson said: We are moving as quickly as possible to ensure that those fleeing Ukraine can find safety in the UK through the Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine. We continue to speed up visa processing across both schemes with 25500 visas issued in the last three weeks alone and thousands more expected to come through these uncapped routes. While we have streamlined the process simplified our forms and boosted case worker numbers vital security checks are needed to protect our borders and the British people from hostile state actors from Russia who would cynically take advantage of the support we are rightly providing to people fleeing Ukraine.

Cumbria-Ukraine refugee scheme numbers uncertain,"If applications are approved about 150 people would be able to live in the county, figures suggest.",Cumbria-Ukraine refugee scheme numbers uncertain Published 2 hours ago Share IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Cumbria County Council said it was scaling up its response team to help those who have fled the war About 100 households in Cumbria have registered to offer their homes to Ukrainian refugees under a government sponsorship scheme figures reveal. If applications are approved it would allow about 150 people to live in the county for up to three years. But the council said due to specific challenges with the plan there was still uncertainty about how many would eventually arrive. It comes as a community welcome fund has raised more than £30000 to help. The Homes for Ukraine scheme allows people to host refugees who dont have family ties in the UK with households offered £350 a month for up to 12 months. It was introduced after the government was criticised for not doing enough but critics have called the process too slow and bureaucratic. I sat in class wondering if my parents were dead How can I offer a UK home to Ukrainian refugees? The county council will receive £10500 for each refugee which will go towards supporting them locally. While it has several roles in the process including housing suitability checks it has no part in registering or matching sponsors the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Deborah Earl cabinet member for public health and communities said it was scaling up its team to respond. Specific challenges It is no small step to invite strangers to live with you and we and our partners will work with you to make this experience as positive as possible for everyone involved she said. There is no doubt however that there are specific challenges with this scheme not least the uncertainty of how many Ukrainians will eventually arrive and where they will be accommodated. The government said it was moving as quickly as possible to ensure refugees from Ukraine can find safety in the UK through its two schemes. We have streamlined the process so valid passport holders do not have to attend in-person appointments before arriving in the UK simplified our forms and boosted caseworker numbers while ensuring vital security checks are carried out a spokesperson added.

Ukraine war: Bucha street littered with burned-out tanks and corpses,"A BBC team witnesses utter devastation in the town of Bucha, after Russian soldiers pulled out.",Ukraine war: Bucha street littered with burned-out tanks and corpses By Jeremy Bowen BBC News Bucha Published 9 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE BBC/LEE DURANT Image caption A Bucha street littered with destroyed Russian armoury A suburban avenue in Bucha became one of the first graveyards for Russias hopes of encircling and entering Kyiv and then deposing the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky. The moment came two or three days after the first Russian forces crossed into Ukraine on 24 February when Ukrainian forces destroyed a column of Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers moving through the town of Bucha to the city of Kyiv. The convoy was destroyed in one of the first of many Ukrainian ambushes that stopped the Russian advance dead. Our BBC team was able to get to Bucha because during Friday the final Russian soldiers pulled out as part of what the Kremlin has presented as a calm and rational decision to concentrate on the war in eastern Ukraine. Moscow says without proof or any reliability that its war aims in central Ukraine have been achieved and they never included capturing Kyiv. The truth is that unexpectedly fierce and well organised Ukrainian resistance stopped them outside the capital and the evidence includes the rusting and twisted wreckage of the column that still lies where it was destroyed on that suburban street. IMAGE SOURCE BBC/KATHY LONG Image caption Local residents say they hadnt had any bread for weeks Two or three weeks into the war the Russian invaders ran out of momentum. On the street in Bucha you can see why. Elite troops from Russias airborne forces rode into the town in armoured vehicles light enough to be carried by aircraft. They came from Hostomel airport a few miles away which had been attacked and seized by Russian paratroopers landed by helicopter on the first day of the invasion. Even then there was fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces. When the column moved through Bucha on the way to Kyiv they had a harsh awakening. The road is narrow and straight an ideal place for an ambush. Witnesses said the Ukrainians attacked the convoy with Bayraktar attack drones bought from Turkey. Other neighbours said Ukrainian territorial defence volunteers were also in the area. However they did it the lead vehicles and the ones bringing up the rear were knocked out and imprisoned the others. The wreckage has not been touched. Belts of 30mm cannon shells lie on the grass verge along with many pieces of dangerous and damaged abandoned ordnance. Young conscripts ran away begging local people said not to be turned over to Ukrainian territorial defence. A man of around 70 who called himself uncle Hrysha said: I felt sorry for them. They were so young 18 to 20 with their whole lives ahead of them. It looks as if Russians as they prepared to pull out of Bucha had no such pity. At least 20 dead men were lying in the street as Ukrainian troops entered the town. Some of them had their hands tied behind their backs. The mayor said they had buried 280 people in mass graves. A few civilians who stayed said they had tried to avoid the Russians. They set up wood fires outside their Khrushchev-era flats cooking on them outdoors because their gas power and water were cut. Volunteers are bringing supplies in from Lviv in western Ukraine and from countries far from the war geographically at least. This is the first bread we\ve had in 38 days said a woman called Maria looking at a plastic bag with some modest looking buns inside. Her daughter Larysa showed me round the Soviet-built apartment building. Many of the people who had left for safer areas or abroad had bolted shut security doors. The Russians removed them by ripping out the concrete lintels and door posts. IMAGE SOURCE BBC/KATHY LONG Image caption Doors ripped off in a Bucha apartment block A few miles away the trail of devastation leads to Hostomel airport. Russian airborne troops tried to use it as a base for a push into Kyiv. The worlds largest transport plane was destroyed early on. The roof of the enormous hangar built for it was so riddled with a constellation of shrapnel holes. The plane itself known by the Ukrainian word for dream (Mriya) lies there broken-backed big chunks of fuselage and engine in places around it. Its fate is a parable of what is happening to Ukraine. An enormous amount of national pride was invested in the aircraft as a symbol of Ukraines ability to make big projects all round the world.

"Ukraine war: Europe's new security era, faced with Russian threat","Many commentators say Ukraine's war has united Europe as hasn't been seen in years, but are they right?",Ukraine war: Europes new security era faced with Russian threat Katya Adler Europe editor @BBCkatyaadler on Twitter Published 11 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption A banner of Russian President Vladimir Putin next to the Moscow embassy in Riga Latvia Era defining new reality historic moment - that\s where we are right now in Europe. At least that\s what countless European politicians and commentators say since Russian President Vladimir Putin began his invasion of Ukraine. Are they right? Yes and No Id argue. Starting with the Yes. On 24 February President Putin shocked this continent out of complacency. His assault on Ukraine has brought large-scale death and destruction back to Europe including whispers of possible nuclear war. His aim: not only to dominate Ukraine but to roll back Western dominance militarily and - ideally - politically in terms of liberal democracy from the former Soviet sphere of influence. The action Western allies take together now will fundamentally affect Europeans sense of self and safety for years to come. Nato is re-invigorated. The transatlantic military alliance once dismissed by French President Emmanuel Macron as brain dead is simultaneously proving Mr Putin wrong to view the West as weak and disunited while also providing military support defence and deterrence to Nato\s eastern flank that feels so exposed to the Kremlin\s expansionist fervour. This - so far - is also proving to be a defining moment for the EU. The bloc had long talked up playing a bigger role on the world stage - and not solely in terms of economics and trade. Until now that was a failed ambition. But the Russia-Ukraine crisis has unexpectedly elevated the EU into a credible geopolitical player. The speed with which Brussels co-ordinated sanctions against Russia - both within the EU and with international allies - was frankly impressive. As were the unity of resolve amongst member states and the bureaucracy-defying EU moves to enact never-before-used mechanisms to help Ukrainian refugees and the Ukrainian military. Germany one of the EUs biggest players also took the worlds breath away by suddenly saying goodbye to World War Two sensitivities and announcing huge investments in its military the Bundeswehr. Key to the decision being applauded in the EU and further afield is that this is not a Germany newly flexing nationalist muscles. This is about Germany helping to re-define Europe not its own role Ricarda Lang told me. She is the co-chair of the German Green Party in the coalition government. It\s about European sovereignty not just in security and defence but also in terms of imports and energy. For years Germany has knowingly been reliant on the US for security and on Russia for energy and trade. It is not the only EU country in that position. But as the blocs richest and most powerful nation Berlin is the most stand-out example. And this has weakened the Wests hand when it comes to sanctions against Russia. EU countries pay Moscow up to €800m (£674m; $884m) for energy every day which amounts to an estimated 40% of the Kremlins income. This money goes towards funding the war against Ukraine that the West is ostensibly fighting. It\s tragic it took a war like this but now we Germans have woken up with a bang! insists Marie Agnes Strack-Zimmerman who heads the German parliament\s Defence Committee. She assured me Berlin was now ready to take responsibility. Image caption We Germans have woken up with a bang! said the chairwoman of the German parliaments Defence Committee The West looked at Germany with suspicion after two world wars she observed but that was decades ago and - to be honest she said - Germany was pretty comfortable enjoying being a Nato and EU member without having to invest in its own army. Germany\s allies have waited too long for us to do our bit. Berlin has now pledged to build an efficient modern military and to keep up defence spending to Nato requirements. Under international pressure trade and energy ties are being tackled too. Bear in mind though that transforming the currently threadbare German military will take years as will untangling the country from its deep-seated relations with Russia. For decades Berlin was the dividing line between East and West Europe. Hopes for European unity were high after the fall of the iconic Berlin Wall and the ensuing 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union. But fast-forward 30 years and you hear talk of a new Berlin Wall though further to the east. Tiny Baltic country Latvia has a 200km (124 mile)-long border fence separating the EU and Nato member on one side from expansionist Russia on the other. Col Sandris Gaugers is the commander of the Latvian Land Forces Mechanized Infantry Brigade. We spoke at his military base just outside the capital Riga. The base is also home to Nato forces which have almost doubled in size since Russia invaded Ukraine. Image caption Col Sandris Gaugers said priorities have changed across Europe I see a new Iron Curtain coming. Though this time we\ll be on the western side the colonel told me. We are living a new reality. For us Latvians the security environment is now gone. We spent 20 years in Iraq in Afghanistan. Now our main focus is here. How do we defend our freedom and our country? Priorities have now changed across Europe he said. People used to focus on economic wealth. Now it\s about defending our values and way of life. Latvians and their Baltic neighbours in Estonia and Lithuania are trying hard not to say I-told-you-so to the West. They\ve been warning about President Putin for years. They feel they understand the Russian leader better than most. All three countries were once part of the Soviet Union. Latvia\s Prime Minister Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš insists the West has to accept that Putin is not like us. France and German leaders famously went on diplomatic visits to Moscow earlier this year trying to dissuade President Putin from attacking Ukraine. Prime Minister Kariņš says agonising over finding the right words or turns of phrase to persuade Mr Putin is pointless. He\s hell-bent on destroying democracy and our way of life. If we don\t stop Putin. He will not stop at Ukraine. Mr Kariņš said the one good thing to come out of the current situation is that Nato and the EU are working closer together than they have in 30 years. That he said was a game-changer. And here we come back to whether this is an era-defining moment for Europe. Or maybe not. The EU is thrilled to have the US back and engaged in Europe. For all Brussels\ talk of the bloc now building strategic sovereignty in defence and security EU countries look to Washington when faced with Russian threats. Image caption Training session at the Adazi military base in Latvia EU defence plans designed to complement - or to partly replace - Nato depending which European politician you speak to are nothing new. And so far theyve never worked. All EU countries agree that at the very least it makes sense to pool resources and know-how: cyber military equipment and intelligence. Yet no nation wants to go first. Each EU member has businesses or individuals benefiting from national contracts. The European Commission now wants to oversee the overhaul of defence capabilities. Few in the military are holding their breath wherever they reside in Europe. As regards the renaissance in EU-Nato co-operation in all likelihood once the acute Russia-Ukraine crisis subsides the US will turn its attention to what it truly sees as its foreign policy priority: the Asia-Pacific not Europe. But the EU has its raison dêtre back. Designed originally as a peace project its vision fell by the wayside in recent times. Younger Europeans had no memory of war. They saw no urgency in uniting or fighting for peace on their continent. In that regard this moment really is a new reality. Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Nato Vladimir Putin European Union]

An AFP news agency reporter in Bucha near Kyiv counted at least 20 bodies. At least one man had his hands tied. Ukrainian forces regained control of the town this week and photos show widespread devastation. BBC journalists in another part of Ukraine found the bodies of two civilians killed by Russian forces. Warning: Some readers may find content in this story distressing including a photo lower down. Earlier this week the BBCs Jeremy Bowen and his team counted a total of 13 bodies some of whom may have been Ukrainian soldiers along a stretch of road between the villages of Mria and Myla. Ukraine says Russian forces have made a rapid retreat from around Kyiv with one official saying the whole region around the capital has been retaken since the invasion began on 24 February. The invasion has seen thousands killed in ferocious fighting and has made refugees of at least four million Ukrainians. Western states have responded with tough sanctions against Russia and military supplies for Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought to justify his attack by arguing that Ukraine a former Soviet state with Nato and EU ambitions was a constant threat and Russia could not feel safe develop and exist. In Bucha where a photographer for Reuters news agency also recorded dead bodies holes gaped from apartment blocks hit by shelling and crushed cars littered the streets. Sixteen of the 20 bodies seen by AFP lay either on the pavement or by the verge. Three were sprawled in the middle of the road and another lay on his side in the courtyard of a destroyed house. An open Ukrainian passport lay on the ground next to the person who had his hands tied behind his back with a piece of white cloth. Two other people had white cloth tied around their upper arms. Warning: There is a photo below that some readers may find distressing A Ukrainian official told AFP the dead men could have been killed in a bombardment or shot by Russian soldiers and police would investigate. But the towns mayor Anatoly Fedoruk told AFP by phone that all of the 20 dead had been shot in the back of the head. He added that other bodies still lay inside the wrecks of cars destroyed by shelling. The town he said had buried 280 people in mass graves as a result of the Russian invasion.

Ukraine war: Family’s bid to reach safety ends in tragedy,The father of 31-year-old Maksim Iovenko describes how his son and family ended up on a deadly stretch of highway outside Kyiv.,Ukraine war: Family’s bid to reach safety ends in tragedy By Abdujalil Abdurasulov and Mal Siret BBC News Published 11 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE SUPPLIED Image caption Ksenia and Maksim met while working at the same travel agency in Kyiv The drone footage shows three cars speeding along an empty main road just outside the Ukrainian capital Kyiv when they suddenly turn around and race back - all except one. This white car turns but then stops. A man steps out and raises his hands. Then his body falls to the ground. Moments later Russian soldiers approach. An elderly woman and child leave the car and a soldier walks them away. The man on the ground was Maksim Iovenko. The 31-year-old was shot dead by Russian forces that were positioned at the roadside. His wife Ksenia who was in the car was also killed. Their six-year-old son and the elderly friend of the family who were with them escaped although she was wounded and remains in hospital. (Both families asked us not to name them.) Until I saw the video I still had some hope Maksim\s father Sergiy Iovenko tells the BBC in Kyiv where he lives. I was hoping that he was alive. The incident happened on 7 March when Maksim and his family joined a convoy of about 10 cars of civilians trying to reach Kyiv from the western outskirts of the city which had become a conflict zone. It was filmed by a Ukrainian territorial defence group doing aerial reconnaissance and widely shared. Media caption Video captured by a Ukrainian aerial reconnaissance group appears to show Russian forces shooting at civilians When a friend of Maksim\s who was part of the convoy called Sergiy to tell him the news Sergiy says he immediately knew something was wrong. There was silence when he picked up the phone and eventually the friend said: Stay strong your son and daughter-in-law are gone. Maksim lived in Kyiv and worked for a travel agency which is where he and Ksenia met. Sergiy describes his son as a family man with a kind heart who liked to sing karaoke. But his biggest hobby was his family he says. He loved his son very much and this was his passion. Like many other Ukrainians Sergiy says he and his family didnt believe Russian President Vladimir Putin would invade. Once Putin did Maksim thought Kyiv would be one of the first cities to be shelled. Having discussed the situation with an old school friend Maksim and his family moved west to the friends second home or dacha on the outskirts of Kyiv not far from the E-40 highway where the shooting would happen. Maksim told his father he thought it would be quieter there. It turned out the opposite Sergiy says. While Russias main focus appeared to be on the east and south of the country Russian forces also started bombing towns and cities to the west of the capital such as Irpin Bucha and Hostomel - close to where Maksim was staying. Sergiy says he would often hear the sound of the heavy bombing from his home in Kyiv. Maksim wouldn\t say much about conditions at the dacha Sergiy says. He would say \it is quiet peaceful all is normal.\ Maksim and his friend also called Maksim would take turns patrolling the area overnight Sergiy says. Power outages and poor mobile signal meant regular contact was difficult. As the bombing continued they moved into the basement leaving only to buy food. Then on 7 March they lost all power. With no electricity heating or food Maksim Ksenia and other families staying in the area decided to return to Kyiv. They knew they risked running into Russian troops along the highway but they thought they could make it through safely. Maksim\s car was third in the convoy made up of about 50 people in total including other children. In the windows of his car he had put handwritten signs on white paper that read: Children. His friend was part of the same convoy and it was his mother who was in the car with Maksim and Ksenia and he was able to tell Sergiy what happened. When the shooting started Maksim\s car was hit. The car\s engine stalled Sergiy says. My son jumped out of the car he raised his hands and started shouting that there was a child in the car so that the child would be saved. Its not clear why the rest of the convoy fell behind the first three cars but Sergiy believes many of those driving behind turned back when they saw the cars in front turning and heard the gunshots. After the shooting Maksims body was left on the highway and Ksenias was left in the car. Maksims son and his friends mother were told by Russian soldiers to walk back along the road. When they got a safe distance from the Russian soldiers she called her husband who came to take them to safety. They returned to the dacha and were evacuated safely to Kyiv the next day. IMAGE SOURCE JEREMY BOWEN Image caption A burned out car on the road where Maksim and Ksenia were killed The boy is with his grandmother in a safe location in Ukraine but away from Kyiv where Sergiy remains. On Friday Sergiy received a call informing him that the area had been re-taken by Ukrainian forces. There was more bad news. They burned everyone. Burned the cars as well Sergiy says. A team of BBC journalists taken to the same stretch of road saw many burned cars and bodies. Among them was Maksims car riddled with shrapnel and reduced to a shell by fire with the burned remains of a body inside it and one on the road beside it still wearing a wedding ring.

Ukraine round-up: Russia sets gas deadline for West and troops leave Chernobyl,"President Putin demands roubles for gas supplies, as Russian troops redeploy around Ukraine.",Ukraine round-up: Russia sets gas deadline for West and troops leave Chernobyl Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES More than five weeks into Russias war on Ukraine Moscow has threatened to cut off Western nations from natural gas supplies - something that could affect energy prices across Europe. Vladimir Putin has followed through on weeks of threats by signing a decree that foreign countries they must start paying for gas in Russian roubles or it will halt supplies. And those new rules start on Friday meaning Western nations were effectively handed a midnight deadline to comply. Nobody sells us anything for free and we are not going to do charity either - that is existing contracts will be stopped the Russian president said. Many payments for April gas deliveries are reportedly not due until later in the month so it is not thought that there is an immediate threat to supplies. It is also still unclear whether the new payment mechanism set out by Russia would fully ban euros. But France and Germany condemned Mr Putin\s demands as being akin to blackmail. Western companies and governments have previously rejected Russias demands to pay for gas in roubles as a breach of existing contracts which are set in euros or US dollars. Yet the EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia and there is no ready-to-go replacement. Notably the EU did not enact sanctions on Russian fuel supplies - even though other Western nations such as the US and Canada did. Mr Putins demand to be paid in roubles is widely seen as an attempt to boost the currency which has been hit by the wide range of international sanctions that followed the invasion of Ukraine. Read the full story about the midnight gas deadline here. Most Russian troops leaving Chernobyl Ukraine says IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Many Russian troops occupying the former nuclear power plant at Chernobyl have left Ukraines state nuclear operator has said. Energoatom said two columns of Russian forces had set off towards the Belarusian border on Thursday morning leaving just a few soldiers at the site. Several days ago the mayor of Slavutych a nearby town housing workers at the plant announced that Russian troops had also left the town. The withdrawal follows reports that some Russian soldiers are being treated for radiation poisoning in Belarus after spending time in the most contaminated part of the Chernobyl exclusion zone. The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was investigating the report. Russias occupation of the site since 24 February the day of the invasion has been dogged with concerns about power outages and problems for the staff many of whom were trapped there for weeks and could not get home. It is the site of what is considered to be the worlds worst nuclear accident in 1986 and while no longer a working power station Chernobyl still requires constant management. Russia redeploying not retreating Troops leaving some occupied areas might sound like a win for Ukraine but Western intelligence warns that Russia is redeploying rather than retreating. Russia is trying to regroup resupply and reinforce Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said. Russia said earlier this week that it was planning to radically reduce its military activity in some places - such as near the capital Kyiv or the city of Chernihiv - and concentrate on the eastern Donbas region. Shelling continues on cities including those Russia suggested it would reduce its assault on but Mr Stoltenberg said Nato can see Russia re-positioning troops. Echoing Mr Stoltenberg\s remarks the UK\s Defence Secretary warned that Russia\s change in tactics was not a retreat and that it was changing its focus after its first efforts were rebutted.

Mariupol evacuation delayed Red Cross says IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS The evacuation of thousands of civilians from the besieged south-eastern city of Mariupol has been delayed until Friday the Red Cross has said. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said a convoy of 45 Ukrainian buses was on its way to the port city but humanitarian officials said the operation had been delayed for security and logistical concerns. One resident of the city Yevgen described the humanitarian disaster civilians have faced to the BBC. It was constant bombing he said. Planes went past every 10 minutes and dropped bombs on Mariupol. People were falling and dying in front of my eyes. We buried people in gardens. Another resident Natalia said Russia soldiers have been infiltrating the city and offering food to civilians in a PR campaign. Some people couldn\t resist taking them because they hadn\t eaten for several days she said. When you\re suffering like that you\ll take anything.

The US correctly assessed that Russia was planning a large-scale invasion while France concluded it was unlikely. In early March Gen Burkhard acknowledged that French intelligence had not been up to the level of US or UK briefings which were publicised to pile pressure on Russia\s Vladimir Putin. The Americans said that the Russians were going to attack they were right he told Le Monde newspaper. Our services thought instead that the cost of conquering Ukraine would have been monstrous and the Russians had other options to bring down the government of Ukraine\s Volodymyr Zelensky he added. Are tech companies removing evidence of war crimes? IMAGE SOURCE MIKE KEMP/GETTY IMAGES Social media companies are used to pulling down vast amounts of content that break the rules erasing it from the internet. Theyre expected to do so by governments and regulators. But what happens when efficient artificial intelligence moderators are removing evidence of possible war crimes sweeping it away from investigators eyes? TikTok for example does not allow shock value or violence or anything that is gratuitously sadistic or gruesome. But Ukrainians uploading videos from the ground could be generating more than likes BBC technology reporter James Clayton writes. They may well be uploading a piece in a jigsaw of evidence that will one day be used to prosecute war crimes. Read more from James about the thorny issue here.

Could Ukraine 'win' the war? And other questions,BBC reporters Jenny Hill and Orla Guerin - on the ground - answer your questions about the war in Ukraine.,Could Ukraine win the war? And other questions Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Russia continues to face fierce resistance from Ukraine more than a month into its invasion. Ukrainian forces have begun attempts to retake some areas from Russia which said this week it would scale back operations around Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv. Meanwhile four million people have fled Ukraine and a quarter of the countrys population is thought to be displaced. Two of the BBCs reporters on the ground answer your questions. Orla Guerin is in Kyiv Ukraines capital Jenny Hill is in the Russian capital Moscow In light of the recent counter-attacks that Ukraine has undertaken and assuming that diplomatic talks between Ukraine and Russia fail is it possible that Ukraine may be able to win this war militarily? - Harry Tinsley Orla Guerin writes: In military terms its a case of so far so good for Ukraine. It has surprised President Putin and the world by mounting skilled and stubborn resistance against a larger better equipped army. Equally Russian forces have surprised the world by being disorganised and inept. We saw an example of Ukraines success in battle at a frontline position outside Kyiv last week. Ukrainian forces told us the Russians had tried to break through four times in the past month and each time had been held back. The evidence was there in the form of about a half dozen burnt-out Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers. Russias invasion is now in its sixth week and it has failed on the key fronts - the Russians have not managed to enter the capital Kyiv to topple the government or to take any major city - bar Kherson - in the south. Russia has destroyed more than it has captured. Thats a poor return on a costly invasion. That said its too early to predict the outcome here. We may be at the start of a long war. Russia says it will focus now on the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. It may have little choice having failed to make gains elsewhere. But in the future it could resume trying to capture more territory elsewhere. Mr Putins fate is probably tied to the success or failure of the invasion. He may continue to pour in troops and armour and heavy weapons over the longer term. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption A destroyed Russian tank in Trostyanets Ukraine. With Russia recruiting from the Middle East does this show a lack of confidence in the quality of its own forces? - David Carter Jenny Hill writes: The Kremlin would never admit to it but there is evidence that at least some of the Russian troops are inexperienced and unprepared for their mission. The Ministry of Defence was recently forced to admit that - contrary to Mr Putins claims - conscripts had been sent to fight in Ukraine. Moscow claims to have 16000 Middle Eastern volunteers many of whom fought against Isis in the last decade ready to join Russian troops. They may have more experience than some of their Russian counterparts and some experts say they\d probably be more skilled in the kind of urban combat necessary to take cities and towns. Some argue too that they\d be less reluctant to attack or kill Ukrainian civilians (many Russians have close ties to Ukraine and consider the people there to be brethren) and that they have a reputation for brutality which could have a psychological effect on Ukrainian troops. The Kremlin presumably knows all this which is why it was so keen to publicise its access to Middle Eastern fighters - even though it has not yet officially confirmed that it will actually send them in. To what extent will unexploded ordnance remain an issue for Ukraine after the war? Is there potential for large areas of land to be deemed inaccessible as a result? - Robbie Orla Guerin writes: Sadly yes as so often in conflict the danger to human life will remain long after the guns eventually fall silent. The danger comes not only from unexploded ordnance but also from landmines. They can kill for years to come unless and until demining organisations can clear frontline areas. I have seen these organisations at work after other wars. Their work is painstaking and time-consuming. Before the invasion began there was already a war raging in the east of the country between Russian-backed separatists and the government of Ukraine. It began in 2014 and has dragged on ever since. While reporting from frontlines there in late January and February we had to carefully skirt many minefields. At that time the snow was melting - turning the soil to mud. In these conditions mines can easily shift from their original location (which may have been marked on maps or fenced off). Currently in the commuter town of Irpin north of Kyiv the Ukrainian army says there is a high risk to life because of mines in the streets. Is it getting more or less likely that the people in Russia will overthrow Mr Putin or cause greater civil unrest the longer the conflict lasts? - Damien Fieldhouse Somerset Jenny Hill writes: Less likely. The Kremlin comes down hard on those who oppose the war and many Russians who think that way have fled. What were almost daily street protests have dwindled. State opinion polls have to be viewed with some cynicism but they consistently show majority (and growing) support for Mr Putin and for his special military operation. Given that most independent Russian media outlets have been blocked or forced to close there are few alternatives to state media which sticks to the Kremlin narrative. That says that Russian troops have only gone into Ukraine to defend the Russian-speaking population from attacks and genocide perpetrated by Ukrainian nationalists and neo-Nazis. If you only watched state TV you might well conclude that this is indeed an honourable and necessary operation to save Russian speakers and Russia itself from an aggressive Ukraine which with the help of America is developing biological weapons and is desperate to get its hands on nuclear ones. Sanctions are starting to have a noticeable effect with prices rising but the Kremlin frames this as another example of Western aggression. At this stage its hard to see any public dissatisfaction evolving into revolution. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Who is going to pay to rebuild the damage inflicted on infrastructure in Ukraine - never mind the human cost? - Steve Sandercott Rugby Orla Guerin writes: The greatest cost is the human one and that is increasing by the day. The verified civilian death toll according to the United Nations is about 1200 people but the real number will be far higher. Add to this the fact that four million Ukrainians have had to flee and become refugees in other countries. There is also extensive physical destruction in cities and towns across this vast country. Nowhere has suffered more than Mariupol in the south where we spent 10 days in the countdown to the invasion. At that point it was a bustling port city with trendy cafes busy restaurants and families strolling in the parks. Satellite imagery of Mariupol now shows mostly scorched earth with 90% of residential buildings damaged or destroyed. As many as 5000 people are known to have been killed in this city alone according to Ukrainian officials. They say the actual death toll could be twice that. Ukraine\s President Volodymyr Zelensky has promised to restore every house every street and every city. He says Russia will have to learn the word \reparations\ and pay the full cost. Ukraine will certainly want reparations to be a key part of any deal done to end the war. If Russia pays - and how much - will depend on who has the upper hand when that deal is done. Theoretically Russian assets abroad frozen by G7 countries could be used to help foot the bill. If a peace deal were to happen how would Ukraine/Russia deal with Crimea the regions taken by Russia in the Donbas this past month and the areas that have been controlled by Russian-backed rebels for the past few years? - Ryan McGauley Jenny Hill writes: We know that Mr Putin wants the world to recognise Crimea which Russia annexed in 2014 as Russian. During negotiations earlier this week the Ukrainian side suggested that Crimeas status be negotiated over 15 years as part of an overall peace deal although its hard to see Mr Putin agreeing to that. He also wants the international community to recognise (as he has) the self-proclaimed peoples\ republics of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent (although this would basically mean Russian-controlled). Given that the Kremlin\s current plan is to intensify its efforts in eastern Ukraine in order to liberate the whole Donbas region we can assume that Mr Putin intends to try to take - and hold on to - the region. Weve seen the Ukrainian military be very effective in certain areas. What prevents the military from destroying the Russian artillery that is shelling their cities? - Paul Ackrill Orla Guerin writes: Independent military experts point to one possible factor. They say Russia is firing artillery from tracked vehicles that can quickly move location once they have fired. That makes them harder to target. Ukrainian forces have told us they also are constrained because of the presence of civilians in built-up areas from which Russia is firing. They dont want to risk killing their own people while targeting Russian artillery. This has been an issue in the towns like Bucha outside Kyiv where some civilians remained despite the presence of Russian forces. Around Kyiv Ukrainian forces have managed to push back the Russians limiting the scope for them to use artillery. Because the city centre is out of reach Mr Putins men have been unable to bombard Kyiv as they have Mariupol and have resorted to air strikes. However Ukrainian air defences have been working well. Several times here in Kyiv we have heard the massive bang when a Russian missile is brought down - sometimes with casualties on the ground. In general Ukraine has been pleading for more and better air defence systems to help it curb the Russian threat. And the constant demand here is for Nato to impose a no-fly zone. We have met civilians fleeing the shelling of Irpin who pleaded for Nato to close the skies. However few here believe there is any chance of that because of Western fears of becoming embroiled in a wider war. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Ukrainian servicemen prepare for battle east of Kyiv Mr Putin has placed massive restrictions on the media in Russia but is there a possibility that news reported by Ukraine - for example the numbers of deaths of troops and civilians - is not wholly accurate? - Sarah Oxford Orla Guerin writes: Both sides are fighting an information war as well as the war on the battlefields. In any conflict information from any of the warring parties - about civilian deaths territory captured or enemy soldiers killed - has to be taken with caution. This is especially true now in relation to Russia - which is trying to ensure that its people receive only the Kremlin\s version of events. It still refuses to admit that it invaded Ukraine and refers only to its special military operation. We prioritise first-hand reporting which is why the BBC has teams in so many parts of Ukraine - gathering testimony from people on the ground including civilians medical staff local officials and the Ukrainian military. Ukraine is acknowledging that it has suffered losses and BBC teams in different cities have been able to report on the funerals of Ukrainian soldiers killed in battle. We cant know yet if the full extent of the losses is being made public. Are there any anti-war Russians? Are they safe? - Roanna Brighton Jenny Hill writes: Yes there are but its difficult to assess how widespread such dissent really is. Speaking out against the war - or even telling the truth about what Mr Putin continues to insist is only a special military operation - can result in a criminal conviction and possibly a jail sentence. Its reported that more than 15000 people were detained for taking part in almost daily street protests during the first three weeks of the invasion. Most independent journalists and many Russians who oppose the invasion have fled the country for places like Turkey Armenia and Georgia. The Kremlin calls them traitors and some of those who have stayed have become the target of abuse or attacks. We are seeing the point of view of frontline Ukrainian soldiers but is it possible to get the perspective from the Russian side? Are you prevented by the Russians from reporting on and talking to Russian troops on the ground in Ukraine? - Robert Bishops Stortford Jenny Hill writes: I cant answer for my colleagues currently in Ukraine but the Kremlin tightly controls the flow of information back to Russia. The Ministry of Defence issues frequent updates which consistently emphasise the success of the special military operation. Russian soldiers are banned from using smartphones and Moscow has made it a criminal offence to publish information which would discredit the Russian military or to spread what the Kremlin would deem to be fake news about it. An independent organisation exists which aims to help families of servicemen to get information about them. However theyve recently told us that theyre under considerable pressure from the authorities to stop their activities.

South Central Ambulance Service prepares to send aid to Ukraine,Medical equipment is being sent to supply field hospitals on the front line.,South Central Ambulance Service prepares to send aid to Ukraine Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption Kate Ellis said the items had come from across the region and would not have been used by the service An ambulance service is sending medical equipment to field hospitals in Ukraine to help the most severely injured soldiers and civilians. South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) said the supplies could maintain a field hospital for up to a fortnight. It said the items could potentially save thousands of lives while they await emergency surgery in hospital. Supplies have come from Oxfordshire Hampshire Buckinghamshire Berkshire Surrey and Sussex. Image caption All of the items loaded into the lorry will be taken further into Ukraine by humanitarian groups They were being packed by staff and volunteers on Friday at Boundary Park in Didcot. Preparations will continue on Saturday. All of the supplies will fit into a lorry and will go directly to field hospitals. Kate Ellis paramedic team leader said: SCAS has been very kind and donated items that we don\t use any more. We\re sending a huge amount of stuff to help those out in the field. Image caption The items will mean severely injured soldiers and civilians can be treated for up to 24 hours before being taken to hospital The lorries will be driven out of Oxfordshire by Ukrainian nationals on Saturday evening and will be unloaded at a depot in western Ukraine. They will then be taken further into the country by humanitarian groups. Paul Wilson from Grove is helping the effort. His Ukrainian wife Svetlana is in Poland trying to secure a UK visa for her mother who escaped her home country last week. Everything you see here is going directly to Ukraine and it\s going to the places that need it the most - Odessa Mykolaiv Chernihiv Kharkiv Kyiv Lviv. All of the places where people are injured we are sending medical aid and food to keep them going he said. Will Hancock chief executive of SCAS said: We are all extremely proud of this work to support those most in need. The resolve everyone has shown to not only keep delivering in the day job after such a tough time of late but also drive forward with this outstanding voluntary programme is truly amazing.

Lincoln City to silence Dambusters March and air raid sirens due to Ukraine war,"Lincoln City has asked supporters to support the move, sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",Lincoln City to silence Dambusters March and air raid sirens due to Ukraine war Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GEOGRAPH/STEVE DANIELS Image caption Lincoln City supporters have backed a move to stop playing the Dambusters March at home games A football club has suspended the playing of the Dambusters March and the use of an air raid siren at matches while the war in Ukraine continues. Traditionally the famous World War Two film theme had been played before each Lincoln City home game while the siren was sounded ahead of corner kicks. But the club and fans said they should be silenced for the rest of the season. Lincoln City claims a long association with the Dambusters 617 Squadron which was based at nearby RAF Scampton. The EFL League One side agreed the move at a supporters board meeting. Challenging matter Lincoln City FC chief executive Liam Scully said the club wanted to strike an appropriate balance between its long-standing synonymous gestures and actions. The decision was a very challenging matter to navigate and could polarise views Mr Scully said. He asked asked fans to support the move in the spirit the decision was made and said it would be reviewed at the end of the season. However Lincoln City fan Alex Webber said he did not feel that playing the Dambusters March was disrespectful. I believe the club should look at reinstating our anthem before the matches and in the second half when the teams come out he said. I can understand not using the air raid siren due to the ongoing bombing in Ukraine and how that would make people feel. IMAGE SOURCE GEOGRAPH/RICHARD CROFT Image caption Bomber crews often used Lincoln Cathedral as a landmark to guide them home Meanwhile Ben Ward who has followed Lincoln for 30 years said he thought the silence was probably fair enough given we have a large Eastern European/Ukrainian component to the population in Lincoln who will likely be on edge. He added: I think there\s been a massive overreaction to these two things. I don\t think missing a siren for four games is a decision that\s killing the club. The Dambusters 617 Squadron famously flew Lancaster bombers from RAF Scampton to destroy dams in Germanys Ruhr Valley during World War Two. Many bomber crews used Lincoln Cathedral as a landmark to let them know they had returned home safely. Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook Twitter and Instagram.

Homes for Ukraine: These people did not ask for war,Jacquie Clayton has welcomed two sisters into her house under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.,Homes for Ukraine: These people did not ask for war Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE JACQUIE CLAYTON Image caption Svitlana (left) and Yulia (right) have been welcomed into Jacquie Claytons Edinburgh home A woman who flew to Poland to help refugees fleeing Ukraine has welcomed two sisters from the war torn country into her Edinburgh home. Jacquie Clayton travelled to Krakow to help out in a soup kitchen as the humanitarian crisis unfolded. There she witnessed absolutely heart-breaking scenes which convinced her to join the Homes for Ukraine scheme. And on Sunday Svitlana and Yulia Derkach arrived in Scotland to stay with Ms Clayton and her husband Colin. So far 2700 visas have been issued for refugees coming to the UK as part of the initiative - fewer than 10% of the 28300 applications made in the schemes first 15 days. Ms Clayton had been critical of the bureaucracy faced by applicants but she told BBC Scotland of her relief that Svitlana 25 and 18-year-old Yulia were finally safe. The sisters are originally from Zhytomyr a city about 120km (75 miles) west of Kyiv. They were both based in the Ukrainian capital when the Russian invasion was launched on 24 February. But their parents have stayed behind to look after elderly relatives despite the region coming under heavy bombardment. Homes for Ukraine: 2700 visas issued government reveals How to sponsor Ukrainian refugees How many people have fled Ukraine? After Ms Clayton signed up for the scheme Svitlana got in touch with her and they built up a rapport on WhatsApp. She shared pictures of her family home and Edinburgh before they met for the first time. And Ms Clayton hopes others with spare rooms in their home will do the same. She said: I think we have seen enough on TV. These people did not ask for war. This should never have happened in the 21st century. All they are looking for is sanctuary and safety. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Intense daily bombing has left many of Zhytomyrs residents homeless Svitlana believes she has found both in Scotland. She said: We are very relieved. We are happy we are safe now and our parents don\t have to worry about our safety. Svitlana was working as a paralegal when Russia launched the invasion that she never imagined was possible. She said: It was really a shock to wake up from my father\s call at 5am to say: \The war has started. Pack your things and get out of the city\. It was really hard to stay in Kyiv and very dangerous. She also had to endure the fear and uncertainty of what was unfolding in her home region where school buildings and key infrastructure have been destroyed. Since the weekend Svitlana has been overwhelmed by the welcome her and her sister have received from the Clayton family. She said: We are very happy and very lucky. I did not expect such kindness from strange people I met on the internet. Their support is unbelievable. IMAGE SOURCE DERKACH FAMILY Image caption Svitlana and Yulia Derkach with their parents in Ukraine Yulia was studying geography and English at a university in Kyiv when the conflict started. She admitted the experience of moving to a new country at a time of great uncertainty in her homeland had been stressful. But Yulia added: The moment I saw our sponsors I felt really relieved because they met us with such warmth and love and I did not expect this. Ms Clayton hopes the young women will become lifelong friends and that she will be able to one day visit them in Ukraine. In the meantime she is showing them around Edinburgh. And next week they will attend a concert by singer-songwriter Jack Savoretti at the citys Usher Hall. Ms Clayton said: I want them to have as normal a life as possible while they are here.

"Ukraine war to halve global trade growth, warns WTO",The World Trade Organisation says ongoing pandemic-related supply chain problems are also hurting growth.,Ukraine war to halve global trade growth warns WTO By Jonathan Josephs Business reporter BBC News Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption The WTOs director general Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is worried that a food crisis is brewing The Ukraine war has led the World Trade Organization (WTO) to cut its global trade growth forecast for this year. The previous 4.7% growth forecast has been cut to 2.5% due to the impact of the war and related policies said WTO boss Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. The cut is also linked to continuing global supply chain problems that started as a result of the pandemic. She said disruptions would make food more costly saying my worry is that we have a food crisis that is brewing. Dr Okonjo-Iweala told the BBC that although Russia and Ukraine only make up about 2.5% of global merchandise exports they are very very significant in certain sectors. The first worry of course is for the people of Ukraine who are being displaced and] not having enough food to eat she said. Ukraine war could hit global growth OECD warns Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices The economic cost of Chinas zero-Covid policy She added the global economy was going to suffer some severe consequences and said poorer countries would particularly feel the impact of the shortages and the supply constraints on food. Supplies of many food products including wheat and corn have been affected following Russias invasion of Ukraine. Industry groups have warned the EU faces a shortage of sunflower oil. In total 46.9% of global exports come from Ukraine and 29.9% from Russia according to S&P Global but with Ukraines ports closed it is struggling to export it. I\m truly worried about looming hunger particularly in poor countries that can least afford it Dr Okonjo-Iweala warned. Using Africa as an example the former Nigerian finance minister said 35 of 55 countries there imported wheat and other grains from Russia and Ukraine and 22 imported fertiliser. Work being done by the African Development Bank now shows that in many countries food prices are rising by 20% to 50% already she said. However Dr Okonjo-Iweala said she was hopeful there were solutions to the supply problems. She said in the short term countries could be changing our dietary tastes to eat more homegrown products. She added in the longer term Africa was investing in heat tolerant varieties of wheat and other crops as it adapts to climate change. Media caption Watch: Ros Atkins on why the war in Ukraine is pushing up food prices - and the likely impact on poorer countries As well as food prices surging the cost of other commodities have hit record highs amid concerns the war and economic sanctions on Russia will lead to supply disruptions. Russias mining industry is hugely important for many substances such as palladium where it is responsible for 40% of global production of the metal that is essential for carmakers. Even before the war in Ukraine the pandemic had caused a mismatch between supply and demand in many industries which pushed prices up and the International Monetary Fund has warned that soaring inflation will reduce global economic growth this year. In the short to medium term I think that we are going to see these inflationary pressures continue Dr Okonjo-Iweala said. Trade battle with Russia Trade has become a key tool many countries have used to pressure President Vladimir Putin over his decision to invade Ukraine. Ukraine has cut economic ties with Russia and led calls for it to be suspended from the WTO because of the war. However no country has ever been expelled from the WTO something the Director-General said is not an easy thing to do. She says there is no mechanism to kick Russia out despite some leading international trade lawyers disagreeing. You can watch Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala\s full interview on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst this weekend. Viewers in the UK can watch the show on Sunday at 15:30 on the BBC News Channel. In other countries it will be on BBC World News at Saturday at 23:30 GMT Sunday at 05:30 & 16:30 GMT and Monday at 07:30 & 16:30 GMT]
Homes for Ukraine: Visas for 210 Ukrainians to flee to Scotland,"With more than four million people displaced by war, Nicola Sturgeon says the figure is ""woefully small""",Homes for Ukraine: Visas for 210 Ukrainians to flee to Scotland Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Visas have been issued for 210 Ukrainians to travel to Scotland under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. About 32200 applications have been made to the UK government scheme which is open to refugees with a named sponsor. However with more than four million Ukrainians displaced by war the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the figure was woefully small. The UK government said applications were processed as quickly as possible. Since the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme launched on 14 March a total of 4700 visas - less than 15% of applications - have been issued in the UK. Another 24000 visas - about 75% of the 32800 applications - have been issued to Ukrainians with family in the UK under a separate scheme. Refugee host: These people did not ask for war How can I offer a UK home to Ukrainian refugees? Super sponsor scheme opens for Ukrainian refugees The aim of Homes for Ukraine was to allow individuals charities community groups and other organisations to sponsor refugees housing them in their homes or buildings. The Scottish government said it wanted to be a super sponsor of Ukrainian refugees and vowed to provide people fleeing the war with temporary accommodation until a longer-term place can be found. A total 210 visas have been issued through the scheme so far - 180 visas to those who had an individual sponsor in Scotland and 30 who had applied to be sponsored through the Scottish governments super sponsor initiative. Woefully small number of visas granted Speaking after the new figures were published on Friday Nicola Sturgeon said the figure isn\t good enough. The process of translating applications into visas is unacceptably slow she added. The UK government is letting the people of Ukraine down and also letting down people across Scotland who have opened their homes. The UK requires the refugees to have a visa before they enter unlike other European countries which have waived the checks to speed things up. Ms Sturgeon added: It is neither reasonable nor morally acceptable to expect people fleeing a brutal invasion to go through the bureaucratic processes being put in their way and wait weeks to be given a visa. We have called for the need for visas to be waived by the UK government] so displaced people could immediately reach a place of safety just as our European neighbours have done. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES A spokesman for the UK government said: We are moving as quickly as possible to ensure that those fleeing Ukraine can find safety in the UK through the Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine. We have streamlined the process so valid passport holders do not have to attend in-person appointments before arriving in the UK simplified our forms and boosted caseworker numbers while ensuring vital security checks are carried out. We continue to speed up visa processing across both schemes with over 29000 visas issued in the last three weeks alone and thousands more expected to come through these uncapped routes. The UN refugee agency said more than four million refugees have now fled Ukraine since Russia launched its war in the biggest refugee crisis since World War Two.

War in Ukraine: Russia accuses Ukraine of attacking oil depot,"Russia claims a Ukrainian helicopter raid set fuel tanks ablaze in Belgorod, a Russian city.",War in Ukraine: Russia accuses Ukraine of attacking oil depot Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Media caption WATCH: Firefighters tackle a blaze at an oil storage depot in Belgorod which Russia says was attacked An oil storage depot was set on fire in a Russian city just north of Ukraine after what Russia described as an attack by two Ukrainian helicopters. A video shared on Twitter showed a blaze near apartment blocks in Belgorod 40km (25 miles) from the border. Some clips appeared to show rockets hitting the oil depot. Ukraines top security official however denied Ukrainian forces were behind the attack. For some reason they are saying we are behind it. This does not correspond to reality security council secretary Oleksiy Danilov said. Ukrainian aircraft have not struck targets in Russia previously. Yet Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov accused Ukraine of launching the attack and later Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov gave details. He said that at around 05:00 Moscow time (02:00 GMT) two Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopters entered Russian airspace at extremely low altitude and launched a missile attack on a civilian oil storage facility on the outskirts of Belgorod. Some storage tanks were damaged and caught fire he said. The oil storage facility has nothing to do with the Russian armed forces he said. President Vladimir Putin\s spokesman said the incident cannot be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for continuing the talks with Kyiv. So far those peace talks have made little progress. The spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was now trying to reorganise the fuel supply chain to prevent disruption of Belgorods energy supplies. The city of 370000 lies just north of Ukraines second city Kharkiv which has been heavily shelled by Russian artillery and remains surrounded by Russian forces. Governor Gladkov said in a Telegram message that nobody was killed at the oil depot which is run by Russian state oil firm Rosneft. He said emergency workers were trying to contain the fire and there was no threat to residents. The emergencies ministry posted video of the blaze on Telegram. Russias Interfax news agency reported that residents nearby were evacuated and two people were injured at the depot. It said eight fuel tanks were on fire and nearly 200 firefighters were on the scene. Queues of cars later formed at local petrol stations but Mr Gladkov said Belgorods fuel supplies were still plentiful. Russias RIA Novosti news agency says the blaze in three of the tanks has been extinguished but there is still a risk of the fire spreading. On 29 March several explosions were reported at an ammunition depot near Belgorod. Commenting on the oil depot blaze Ukrainian defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said Russian aggression was being resisted on the territory of Ukraine. It does not mean that Ukraine has to bear responsibility for all those catastrophes and all those events that happen on the territory of the Russian Federation. This is not the first time we have seen such accusations. So dear friends I will neither confirm nor deny this information he said. Ukraine is yet to claim responsibility for this attack but if it were confirmed it would be the first time that Ukrainian aircraft have flown into Russian airspace to hit a target. bringing the war home to Russia. Ukrainian helicopter pilots have plenty of experience of flying low and fast to avoid being detected by military radar and air defence systems. Theyve been doing exactly that in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine for years. I experienced and witnessed the extraordinary skills of the Ukrainian military pilots in 2018 - flying barely metres above the tree line and telegraph poles. But if these unconfirmed reports are correct - flying at night well into Russian territory to launch an attack on an enemy fuel depot would have required extraordinary bravery - as well as finely-honed flying skills. Low-flying helicopters are still vulnerable to short-range air defence systems. Flying at night would have lessened that risk but heightened the danger of hitting an object near the ground. The Mi-24 or Hind helicopter is known as the flying tank. Its rockets would have been the weapon deployed to target the oil depot in Belgorod Russia. This alleged attack alone will not dramatically alter the battle. But it could show Ukraine has managed to keep its air force functioning and give a huge boost to the morale of Ukraines military. A well-known Ukrainian journalist in Kyiv Yury Butusov posted on Facebook that it was a missile attack at 05:50 local time (02:50 GMT) by two Ukrainian Mi-24 combat helicopters which flew from Ukraine to Russian Belgorod over low altitudes inconspicuous for Russian anti-aircraft defence. Vladimir Soloviev host of a staunchly pro-Kremlin current affairs programme on Russian state TV asked in a tweet: Question. Who is in charge of the Belgorod air defences? Have the bases of the helicopters that delivered this strike been destroyed? When will a safe zone be set up in Belgorod region?

Sir Jeremy Fleming said Chinas long-term interests are not served by an alliance with Moscow. In a rare public address during a visit to Australia Sir Jeremy also said Russia had massively misjudged the situation in Ukraine. He said Vladimir Putin\s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth. Putin advisers too scared to tell him truth - US US warns China against helping Russia in Ukraine Ukraine War: Putin demands Mariupol surrender to end shelling Why has Putin invaded? Sir Jeremy said China\s aspirations to become a leading player on the global stage were not well served by close alliance with a regime that wilfully and illegally ignores international rules. The speech at the Australian National University in Canberra comes after Downing Street said Boris Johnson had a frank and candid discussion with China\s President Xi Jinping last week. Sir Jeremy said that Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a clear strategic choice to align with China as it grows more powerful in opposition to the United States. He said the Kremlin regards China in the current crisis as a supplier of weapons technology and a potential market for its oil and gas. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption GCHQ Director Jeremy Fleming was speaking in Australia But Sir Jeremy suggested President Xi has a more nuanced view of the relationship. Russia understands that long term China will become increasingly strong militarily and economically. Some of their interests conflict; Russia could be squeezed out of the equation. Meanwhile echoing comments from US and Ukrainian officials the GCHQ boss said Mr Putin underestimated the strength of the coalition his actions would galvanise. He under-played the economic consequences of the sanctions regime. He over-estimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory. However Sir Jeremy said the extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime.

Ukraine round-up: Little progress in peace talks as shelling continues,"No breakthrough, says Russia, while Ukraine says Russia has broken a promise to pull back troops.",Ukraine round-up: Little progress in peace talks as shelling continues Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption Chernihiv has no electricity water supply or heat the regional governor told the BBC A quarter of Ukraines people have fled their homes in the 35 days since the war began. And despite high hopes peace talks in Istanbul have reportedly failed to provide even a respite in the fighting let alone a breakthrough. Both sides are in Turkey for the talks with high expectations set on Tuesday. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has since said that while the Ukraine side had set out proposals on paper there was nothing promising in terms of signs of a breakthrough. Ukraine said it could become a neutral state - with security guarantees - to assuage Russias fears it might join the Western military alliance Nato. But Russia dismissed Ukraines proposal for talks about Crimea which Russia annexed by military means in 2014. And as the talks went on officials in Ukraine said there had been no let-up in attacks on the northern city of Chernihiv despite a Russian pledge to reduce military activity there. The governor of the Chernihiv region Viacheslav Chaus told the BBC that the city had experienced a tense night while residents said shelling had continued into Wednesday. Read more about how the effort to boost mutual trust in the peace talks did not turn out as planned. A quarter of Ukrainians have fled their homes IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Refugees wait at a temporary shelter in Poland More than four million people have now fled Ukraine to escape Russias invasion and more than six million are displaced inside the country according to the latest United Nations figures. That means at least a quarter of the population have had to abandon their homes because of the war. Its the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two - Poland alone has received 2.3 million Ukrainian refugees. The BBCs Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says there can be no quick fix to such a major humanitarian crisis. Europes unity and generosity will be needed not for weeks but possibly years she adds. Putin demands Mariupol surrender to end shelling Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that shelling of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol will only end when Ukrainian troops surrender. Mr Putin made the comments during an hour-long phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday night the Kremlin said in a statement. But French officials said the Russian leader had agreed to consider plans to evacuate civilians from the city. It comes as new satellite photos showed the destruction caused by the shelling. The images released by the Earth observation company Maxar showed that residential areas have been reduced to rubble and highlighted Russian artillery cannons in firing positions on the outskirts of the city. IMAGE SOURCE MAXAR How are Russians getting news about the war in Ukraine? IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Marina Ovsyannikova an editor at state-controlled Channel 1 was detained after she ran onto a news set holding a sign saying no war The situation in Russias media is unprecedented. Restrictions on reporting are increasingly severe and access to almost all independent outlets is blocked or limited - or they censor themselves. For most Russians television remains the main source of the news. It is firmly controlled by the Kremlin and pumps out relentless pro-war propaganda. Ukrainians are said to shell their own cities and Russian troops are presented as liberators. There is more variety of opinion in the print press but it still largely sticks to the Kremlin line. The independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta suspended operations on 28 March after receiving warnings from Russias media watchdog Roskomnadzor. But while many independent online outlets are blocked restrictions are relatively easy to get around for internet-savvy Russians familiar with tools like virtual private networks (VPNs). The Meduza and Mediazona websites operate from outside Russia and staff have told authorities in Moscow that they will not silence us. Read more about the Russias war-time media landscape here.

"Scotland-Ukraine World Cup game likely to go ahead, expert says",Some of Ukraine's top players have now been allowed to leave the country ahead of the match in June.,Scotland-Ukraine World Cup game likely to go ahead expert says Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Ukraine are bidding to reach their second mens World Cup finals It is increasingly likely that Scotlands World Cup qualifier against Ukraine will go ahead in June a Ukrainian football expert has said. The match had been due to be played at Hampden last week with the winner then playing Wales for a place in the tournament in Qatar later this year. It was rescheduled for June after Russia invaded but there have been fears Ukraine would not be able play. Journalist Andrew Todos said he believed the game would go ahead. Many of Ukraines top international players play in their domestic league and all men aged between 18-60 had been banned from leaving the country under its martial law rules. However Mr Todos told BBC Radio Scotlands Lunchtime Live programme that players from Dynamo Kiev - one of Ukraines biggest clubs - had now been given special permission by the ministry of sport to play friendly matches outside of the country. Not yet qualified but Scots await World Cup draw Scotland v Ukraine postponed The Ukrainian football expert said: Over the next few weeks or couple of months they\ll be playing - apparently - against sides such as Legia Warsaw Steaua Bucharest Paris Saint-Germain and some other sides have agreed in principle to play them and raise money for the Ukraine humanitarian aid. The fact that the team has been allowed to leave - I think there\s growing optimism that the Ukraine national team will be allowed to convene outside of Ukraine in the next month or so. The Scottish Football Supporters Association (SFSA) launched a petition last month calling for Ukraine to be allowed to qualify automatically for the World Cup without having to play any more matches. Its chairman Andy Smith said FIFA - which has already kicked Russia out of the tournament - had an opportunity to do the right thing even if it meant making it harder for Scotland to qualify. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Ukraine coach Oleksandr Petrakov is trying to set up a training camp for his team ahead of the match with Scotland Mr Todos said the Ukrainian squad was keen to qualify for the tournament by winning on the pitch. He said: The Ukraine captain has already said as long as we\ve got arms and legs we want to finish this on the pitch - we\ll let our soldiers do what they\re doing on the battlefield and we can do this for them. I think the logistics are in place for them to get the kit out to get the training staff out. All that remains is to work out where Ukraine will be based the few weeks before the match starts. Scotland coach Steve Clarke said last week that it was difficult to see the game being played in June because of the war. He said: It\s not just the fixture it\s the fact they need to get together have a training camp and get all their players on the pitch with a proper period of time to prepare for such an important game. His Ukrainian counterpart Oleksandr Petrakov has told the Guardian that he was trying to arrange a training camp for his players outside of the country possibly in the UK ahead of the match. He said his team - many of whom have been unable to play or train since the invasion - would need to play five or six practice matches to return to full fitness without which it would be very hard to get to play with Scotland. Both Scotland and Ukraine will be included in Fridays World Cup draw despite neither having yet qualified for the tournament which will be played in November. Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war]

People in Goudhurst are working together to bring them to the UK under the Home Office scheme to house refugees fleeing the war with Russia. The work is being aided by one of the Kent villagers who is Ukrainian and who has helped translate forms. Vika Gallacher said the Ukrainian families are incredibly touched and so grateful for this opportunity to be safe as Russian bombardments continue.

Ukraine conflict: Russia to allow unauthorised imports from West,The decision is in response to Western sanctions and surging inflation since the war in Ukraine.,Ukraine conflict: Russia to allow unauthorised imports from West Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Russias prime minister said he wanted to saturate the market to create fast access to essential goods Russia is allowing imports without a trademark owners permission in reaction to sanctions that have halted an array of Western products. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin approved parallel imports as part of a fourth package of support for small and medium-sized businesses. The Wests response to Russias war has prompted a surge in inflation. The prime minister said until now goods could not be sold in Russia without the trademark owners authorisation. The aim of letting retailers import products without the companies\ permission he explained was to saturate the market so that people had fast access to necessary goods guaranteeing supply despite the unfriendly actions of foreign politicians. Lists of products were to be co-ordinated with the ministry of industry and trade Mr Mishustin said in a televised address. Russian reports indicate they will focus on consumer products where prices have risen. Annual inflation has soared this week to 15.66%. Sugar in particular has been hit by price rises and shortages and Russias anti-monopoly service said it was investigating the countrys five biggest producers. In a bid to prop up the currency Russia announced last week that unfriendly countries would have to pay for their natural gas in roubles from Thursday. The EU has rejected the idea and Germany said Chancellor Olaf Scholz had been told that Europe would be able to continue paying in euros to a Russian bank not under sanctions which would then convert the money into roubles. Hundreds of global brands such as Apple and H&M have also either pulled out of the Russian market or halted sales since the invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February. Several companies have continued to provide basic nutrition and hygiene items. Sports shop Decathlon said this week it was only closing its shops because of supply chain problems while Nestle has suspended the sale of the vast majority of volume and sales in Russia. In a separate development Russian state institutions have been barred from buying foreign software from Thursday for so-called critical information infrastructure without prior government consent. The decree covers telecom and information systems used by government agencies as well as companies in defence healthcare transport energy and finance.

Yorkshire-built armoured ambulances bound for Ukraine,The former British Army vehicles are being converted to support medics in the war-torn country.,Yorkshire-built armoured ambulances bound for Ukraine Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption Former British Army vehicles are being transformed at two factories in West and East Yorkshire Ex-British Army vehicles are being converted in Yorkshire into armoured ambulances for medics in Ukraine. Manufacturer Venari Group said it was transforming dozens of vehicles at its two factories in Goole and Brighouse. Ukraine is currently losing ambulances at an increasingly rapid rate of 10 per day the company said. Andrew Percy Conservative MP for Brigg and Goole said he was so proud that staff in his constituency were working round the clock on the project. The firm said the military-grade ambulances were designed to carry greater numbers of casualties and would provide ballistic protection from small arms fire on the front line. A spokesperson said: With all-terrain capability they will allow increased manoeuvrability for both paramedics and patients and allow medical teams to treat people who they may not otherwise be able to reach. Image caption The new ambulances are designed to carry greater numbers of casualties the firm says Venari Group CEO Oliver North said his staff were working 24 hours a day - throughout the weekend - to speed-up production time after being contacted by Mr Percy and staff at the Ukrainian embassy. As the UK\s oldest and largest ambulance builder we truly feel it is our duty to deliver on this project with as much passion precision and speed as we possibly can he said. Mr Percy said: Their efforts have been amazing and they should all be very proud of what they are doing to keep medical professionals and patients in Ukraine safe. Funding for the project has come from a number of wealthy Ukrainian businessmen and UK-based blue chip organisations.

Ukraine war: Northern Ireland advice centres to open for refugees,"The four drop-in centres will provide refugees with help on health, education and employment issues.",Ukraine war: Northern Ireland advice centres to open for refugees By Mark Simpson BBC News NI Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES/WOJTEK RADWANSKI Image caption There are no official figures for the number of Ukrainians who have come to Northern Ireland since the Russian invasion began in February Four advice centres are to be opened in Northern Ireland to help the hundreds of refugees who have arrived from Ukraine. The drop-in centres will provide help on health education and employment issues. They will be set up in Belfast Ballymena Craigavon and Newry. There are no official figures for the number of Ukrainians who have come to Northern Ireland since the Russian invasion began back in February. It is estimated that several hundred have arrived already. Most of them came to stay with relatives but Stormont officials say 40 visas have been issued in recent days under the Homes for Ukraine scheme to refugees who say they intend to come to Northern Ireland. Anyone in the UK who takes in a refugee will be entitled to a payment of £350 a month. Unprecedented task to help Ukrainian refugees How can Ukrainian refugees come to the UK? Those who take part in the scheme must commit to providing accommodation for at least six months. Since the scheme opened last month more than 7000 people in Northern Ireland have registered an interest. Ukrainians coming to Northern Ireland are entitled to free public transport as soon as they arrive for their journey to their final destination. Refugees will be asked to produce their passport of Ukrainian government ID for free travel on buses or trains. It is estimated that around 600 Ukrainians were living in Northern Ireland before the war broke out.]
Why has Russia invaded Ukraine and what does Putin want?,"Weeks after Russia's leader unleashed war on Ukraine, there is no sign yet of when it will end.",Why has Russia invaded Ukraine and what does Putin want? By Paul Kirby BBC News Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Media caption Drone footage shows the extent of destruction in cities across Ukraine since the start of the war When Vladimir Putin shattered the peace in Europe by unleashing war on a democracy of 44 million people his justification was that modern Western-leaning Ukraine was a constant threat and Russia could not feel safe develop and exist. But after five weeks of bombardment thousands of deaths in ruined cities and the displacement of more than 10 million people inside Ukraine and beyond the questions remain: what is his aim and is there a way out? What was Putins goal? The Russian leaders initial aim was to overrun Ukraine and depose its government ending for good its desire to join the Western defensive alliance Nato. But the invasion has become bogged down and he appears to have scaled back his ambitions. Launching the invasion on 24 February he told the Russian people his goal was to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine to protect people subjected to what he called eight years of bullying and genocide by Ukraine\s government. It is not our plan to occupy the Ukrainian territory. We do not intend to impose anything on anyone by force he insisted. This was not even a war or invasion he claimed merely the fiction of a special military operation that Russian state-controlled media are required to adopt. The claims of Nazis and genocide in Ukraine were completely unfounded but it was clear Russia saw this as a pivotal moment. Russia\s future and its future place in the world are at stake said foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin. Russias military aimed to sweep into the capital Kyiv invading from Belarus in the north as well as from the south and east. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke of freeing Ukraine from oppression while Ukraine\s democratically elected President Volodymyr Zelensky said the enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two. But Ukraines fierce resistance has caused heavy losses and in some areas driven Russian forces back. Has Putin changed his aims? Russia does appear to have lowered its ambitions claiming it has generally accomplished the aims of the invasion\s first phase which it defined as considerably reducing Ukraine\s combat potential. Russia announced at peace talks that it would be drastically reducing its military operations around the capital and around the northern city of Chernihiv. That is yet to be confirmed and Ukraines President Zelensky has said Ukraine can only trust concrete results not words. The war continues particularly in the east and the south where Russian forces are trying to create a land corridor along the south coast east from Crimea to the Russian border. A month into the invasion Russia declared its main goal was the liberation of Donbas - broadly referring to Ukraine\s eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. More than a third of this area was already seized by Russian-backed separatists in a war that began in 2014. Ahead of the invasion it was clear President Putin wanted all of the east recognising the whole area as belonging to two Russian puppet statelets. The head of the Luhansk statelet has suggested holding a referendum on joining Russia similar to an internationally discredited vote held in Crimea in 2014. Beyond his military goals President Putins broader demand is to ensure Ukraines future neutrality. The Ukrainians have offered that in return for security guarantees from allies as part of a wide-ranging peace plan presented in talks in Turkey. Why Putin wants a neutral Ukraine Since Ukraine achieved independence in 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed it has gradually veered towards the West - both the EU and Nato. Russia\s leader has sought to reverse that seeing the fall of the Soviet Union as the disintegration of historical Russia. He has claimed Russians and Ukrainians are one people and denied Ukraine its long history: Ukraine never had stable traditions of genuine statehood he asserted. It was his pressure on Ukraines pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych not to sign a deal with the European Union in 2013 that led to protests that ultimately ousted the Ukrainian president in February 2014. Russia then seized Ukraines southern region of Crimea and triggered a separatist rebellion in the east and a war that claimed 14000 lives. As he prepared to invade in February he tore up an unfulfilled 2015 Minsk peace deal and accused Nato of threatening our historic future as a nation claiming without foundation that Nato countries wanted to bring war to Crimea. What would neutrality look like? Before Ukraine presented its plans Russia said it was considering a neutral demilitarised Ukraine with its own army and navy along the lines of Austria or Sweden which are both EU members. Austria is neutral while Sweden is non-aligned. President Zelensky had already declared that Ukrainians now understood they would will not be admitted to Nato: It\s a truth and it must be recognised. EPA/Ukraine presidency Security guarantees and neutrality the non-nuclear status of our state - we are ready to go for it... If I remember correctly this is why Russia] started the war Volodymyr Zelensky President of Ukraine Russia does not see Ukraines peace proposals as either promising or a breakthrough so the war will continue. But this is Kyivs offer: Ukraine would become a non-bloc (or non-aligned) and non-nuclear state with no foreign military bases or contingents on its territory Strict legally binding guarantees would require countries such as the UK China the USA Turkey France Canada Italy Poland and Israel to protect a neutral Ukraine in the event of attack Within three days guarantor states would have to hold consultations and come to Ukraines defence Ukraine would be allowed to join the European Union Ukraine would not enter military-political alliances and any international exercises would require consent of guarantor states. Ukraines bid to join Nato (and the EU) is enshrined in its 2019 constitution so any change would require a referendum some months later. What about Crimea and the east? Russia is so far unimpressed with Ukraines plan for the future status of Crimea seized by Russia in 2014 to be decided during 15 years of consultations. The Kremlin says Crimea is now Russian territory and the Russian constitution bars discussing its status with anyone else. As part of Kyivs peace proposals all Russian troops would leave Ukrainian territory and the future of the eastern areas held by Russian-backed separatists would be discussed by the two presidents as part of a ceasefire summit. However President Putin will not wish to abandon any territorial gains made during the war especially as the declared aim is liberating Ukraine\s east. Kyiv meanwhile will never agree to ceding its sovereign territory. Ukraine has never taken seriously Russia\s demand for militarisation and Moscow\s insistence on de-Nazification is merely Russian propaganda. In the words of Ukraine\s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba: It\s crazy sometimes not even they can explain what they are referring to. President Zelensky has said he is prepared to give Russian minority language status along with the languages of other neighbouring countries and does not see this as a major issue. Whats Putins problem with Nato? For Russias leader the Wests 30-member defensive military alliance has one aim - to split society in Russia and ultimately destroy it. Ahead of the war he demanded that Nato turn the clock back to 1997 and reverse its eastward expansion removing its forces and military infrastructure from member states that joined the alliance from 1997 and not deploying strike weapons near Russia\s borders. That means Central Europe Eastern Europe and the Baltics. In President Putin\s eyes the West promised back in 1990 that Nato would expand not an inch to the east but did so anyway. That was before the collapse of the Soviet Union however so the promise made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev only referred to East Germany in the context of a reunified Germany. Mr Gorbachev said later that the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed at the time. Does Putin have designs beyond Ukraine? If he has his military setbacks in Ukraine may have put paid to any wider ambitions beyond Ukraine. After hours of conversations with Russia\s authoritarian leader German Chancellor Olaf Scholz concluded: Putin wants to build a Russian empire... He wants to fundamentally redefine the status quo within Europe in line with his own vision. And he has no qualms about using military force to do so. Tatiana Stanovaya of analysis firm RPolitik and the Carnegie Moscow Center fears a spiral in a new Cold War confrontation: I have very firm feelings that we should get prepared for a new ultimatum to the West which will be more militarised and aggressive than we could have imagined. Having witnessed Mr Putins willingness to lay waste European cities to achieve his aims Western leaders are now under no illusion. President Joe Biden has labelled him a war criminal and the leaders of both Germany and France see this war as a turning point in the history of Europe. Before the war Russia demanded all US nuclear arms be barred from beyond their national territories. The US had offered to start talks on limiting short- and medium-range missiles as well as on a new treaty on intercontinental missiles but there is little chance of that happening for now.

READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis What next for Russia itself? President Putin has been stunned by the scale of the Western response to his invasion. He knew Natos members would never put boots on the ground in Ukraine but he could not have guessed the extent of the sanctions that are already having a dramatic effect on Russias economy - and he is furious. The EU US UK and other Western nations have targeted Russias economy in a variety of ways: Russias central bank has had its assets frozen and major banks are shut out of the international SWIFT payment transfer network. The US has banned imports of Russian oil and gas; the EU aims to cut gas imports by two-thirds within a year; and the UK aims to phase out Russian oil by the end of 2022 Germany has halted approval on Russias Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline a major investment by both Russia and European companies Russian airlines have been barred from airspace over the EU UK US and Canada Personal sanctions have been imposed on President Putin Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and many other individuals No peace deal with Ukraine will bring these sanctions to an end and Vladimir Putin knows that. Instead he has turned on Russians who have opposed the war. The Russian people will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors said Russia\s president. More than 15100 anti-war protesters have been detained and virtually all independent media have been silenced. There is no meaningful political opposition left as they have either fled the country or in the case of opposition leader Alexei Navalny jailed for years in a strict-regime penal colony.]

It has been heavily bombed by Russia. They first travelled to Ukraines capital Kyiv then to the western city of Lviv before fleeing for Poland then Lithuania. They arrived in the UK as part of the Homes for Ukraine scheme which launched two weeks ago. Yet latest figures suggest they are among the lucky ones. Just 2700 visas have so far been granted under the scheme. The number of applications has already passed 28000.

Those with citizenship or settled status are able to bring their family over to stay under a separate Home Office scheme. I think they are very brave making that really terrifying journey Clare told the BBC. I can\t tell them how incredibly sad I am that they have had to make that journey. Hopefully I can just make their lives a little bit better than they have just been experiencing. We had to find the courage to choose the safest moment for us to escape the shelling Olena added.

READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis After we asked the government about the case Garry says Yuliia received an email from the Home Office telling her she needed to upload more photos of her passport. They have now had to make another appointment at the visa centre in Poland. Many hosts in England like Garry are getting much of their information from groups popping up on social media where there is still a steady stream of both people offering accommodation and those seeking a place to say. Some report frustration with the time it is taking to issue visas and the lack of updates. There are also reports of problems uploading documents to the schemes portal as Garry discovered. Scotland and Wales have taken a different approach acting as so-called super sponsors. This means any Ukrainian can apply without a named sponsor and they will initially be given temporary accommodation before a home is found for them. IMAGE SOURCE GARRY TAYLOR Image caption Garry Taylor pictured here with his family made contact with Yuliia via social media There has been criticism of the scheme since it was launched and charities have said the process in England is just too difficult for those fleeing Ukraine. They have called for the UK to stop requiring visas for those fleeing Ukraine. Downing Street meanwhile has said the Home Office has made the process quicker and easier - including making the visa form shorter and allowing valid passport holders to apply online and complete biometric checks in the UK. But refugees minister Lord Harrington acknowledged more needed to be done. We are starting to see progress because of changes the Home Office made to streamline the visa process and put additional resources into the system. However we need to do more and will be making further improvements to bring people to the UK as quickly as possible. I look forward to welcoming more families and ensuring they have the support they need when they arrive. Update: A short time after this story was published Yuliia and her daughter received the final documents they needed to be able to travel to the UK. Additional reporting by NJ Convery.]

Ukraine: Visa to bring family to Cumbria 'took most of the day',"Alla Stoica, who is originally from Kyiv, says getting her relatives to the UK is too complicated.",Ukraine: Visa to bring family to Cumbria took most of the day Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE ALLA STOICA Image caption Alla Stoica has experience of completing visa forms for her parents visits to the UK A Ukrainian woman living in the UK says trying to get visas for her relatives caught up in the war with Russia has been overly complicated and too slow. Alla Stoica from Carlisle Cumbria submitted applications for her sister-in-law and nephew in Kyiv nearly two weeks ago but has heard nothing since. It\s not straightforward at all the 40-year-old former nurse said of the government\s Ukraine Family Scheme. The Home Office said it was moving as quickly as possible. Ms Stoica who is originally from Kyiv but moved to Carlisle 16 years ago said: I\ve got a little bit of experience because the process is similar to applying for a tourist visa and I\ve applied for those for my parents in the past. But still to do two applications for my sister-in-law and my nephew it took most of the day. The Ukraine Family Scheme is for those with close relatives living in the UK and has issued 22800 visas out of 31200 applications the Home Office said. Only 2700 visas have been issued out of 28300 applications made under the Homes for Ukraine scheme in which strangers can offer sanctuary to refugees. A Home Office spokesperson said: We have streamlined the process so valid passport holders do not have to attend in-person appointments before arriving in the UK simplified our forms and boosted caseworker numbers while ensuring vital security checks are carried out. IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption Fighting has continued on the road to the Ukrainian city of Makariv west of Kyiv Fresh efforts are under way to evacuate civilians trapped by Russian forces in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Ms Stoica who is married to a local restaurant owner said she did not believe Russia\s pledge to reduce military action around the capital in order to boost mutual trust in peace talks. I don\t think anyone believes it] she said. She said any scaling down was due to Russian forces being pushed back by Ukrainian troops not because of negotiation. They know they\ve got no chance to take Kyiv she said. I spoke to my brother this morning and there was still heavy shelling and there were still explosions last night and the night before.

Ukraine war in maps: Tracking the Russian invasion,Counter-attacks by Ukrainian forces are successfully regaining territory as Russian forces refocus efforts on the east of the country.,Ukraine war in maps: Tracking the Russian invasion By The Visual Journalism Team BBC News Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Counter-attacks by Ukrainian forces are successfully regaining territory in several areas as Russian forces regroup and refocus their efforts on operations in the east of the country. Here are the latest developments on day 37 of the invasion: Ukrainian forces retaking key positions around Kyiv Shelling remains ongoing in Kyiv and in Chernihiv Russian troops said to be withdrawing from Chernobyl Port city of Mariupol remains likely to fall to Russia soon Ukrainian forces repelling Russian attacks in the Donbas Russia redeploying troops to Ukraine from Georgia Russia launched its attack on 24 February but five weeks into the war it is having to bolster its forces by redeploying troops from Georgia after suffering unexpected losses according to the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD). Ukrainian counter-attacks have pushed Russian troops back in a number of places and the MoD says that Russia is struggling to sustain its operations across multiple areas of engagement. Ukrainians fight back around Kyiv Russian forces have lost ground around Kyiv in recent days and they have moved from trying to encircle the capital to withdrawing to positions that are more easily defended according to Jack Watling a defence analyst at the Royal United Services Institute. Ukrainian forces have successfully pushed Russian troops back in a number of areas on the outskirts of Kyiv including in the suburb of Irpin about 20km (12 miles) to the west. These counter-attacks are pushing Russian artillery further out of range of central Kyiv but shelling of the suburbs has continued as Russian forces try to defend their positions. To the east of the capital Ukrainian forces have reclaimed ground from the Russians around the suburb of Brovary about 20km (12 miles) away from the centre of Kyiv. The Russian advance on Kyiv from the east has been hindered by the failure to take control of Chernihiv a major city to the north-east that sits between the capital and the Russian border. The aerial bombardment of Chernihiv has continued in recent days but analysts at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) say some Russian units are being withdrawn from around the city - and from around Kyiv Chernobyl and Sumy - to be redeployed in the east of the country.

FUEL: Could the world cope without Russian oil? READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Russian progress slows in the south Russian forces initially made rapid gains in the south with their main objective being the creation of a land corridor between Crimea which it annexed in 2014 and areas held by Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk. Standing in the way of that objective has been the port city of Mariupol which has been encircled by Russian forces since the start of March. Russian forces have been advancing further into the centre of Mariupol recently and the city is likely to fall within days according to the ISW. More than 100000 civilians are thought to be trapped in the besieged city and its deputy mayor says people there are dying from starvation and dehydration. To the west Russia had been attempting to push towards Odesa with the aim of cutting off Ukraines access to the Black Sea. But their advances stalled at Mykolaiv where a counter-attack by Ukrainian troops has pushed Russian forces back towards the city of Kherson. Russian troops in the area are now concentrating on maintaining their current positions rather than taking new ground according to the ISW. Russia targets full control in the east With recent setbacks elsewhere in the country Russian officials have said that the focus of its forces is now the complete liberation of the Donbas. The Donbas broadly refers to Ukraines eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before Russias invasion. Analysts says Russian forces in the region are trying to encircle Ukrainian troops there by advancing from Kharkiv to the north and Mariupol from the south. But Ukrainian forces have repelled several recent assaults particularly around the town of Rubizhne and Russian forces have failed to make any significant gains recently according to the ISW.

About these maps To indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the Institute for the Study of War with the American Enterprise Institutes Critical Threats Project. From 2 March this daily assessment differentiated between Assessed Russian-controlled Ukrainian territory and Assessed Russian advances in Ukraine the latter indicating areas where Russians are believed to have launched attacks from but which they do not control. To show key areas where advances are taking place we are also using daily updates from the UK Ministry of Defence and BBC research. The situation in Ukraine is fast moving and it is likely there will be times when there have been changes not reflected in the maps.

"Ukraine war: Russian troops leave Chernobyl, Ukraine says",Ukraine's state nuclear company says Russian soldiers have left the former nuclear power plant.,Ukraine war: Russian troops leave Chernobyl Ukraine says Published 2 days ago comments Comments Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption There have been concerns about safety at the former plant since the Russian occupation Russian troops occupying the former nuclear power plant at Chernobyl have left the plants staff say. According to Ukraine\s state nuclear company Energoatom staff at the plant said there are currently no outsiders at the site. Earlier it said some Russian forces had set off towards the Belarusian border leaving a small group behind. The announcement appears to confirm reports by senior US defence officials on Wednesday of a withdrawal. Russian troops seized Chernobyl at the beginning of their invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. This morning the invaders announced their intentions to leave the Chernobyl nuclear power plant Energoatom said in a statement on Thursday. The company later accused the Russian military of abducting members of the Ukrainian National Guard held captive since the start of the war. Energoatom sourced its information to workers at the plant and did not give numbers. It also confirmed reports that Russian troops had dug trenches in the most contaminated part of the Chernobyl exclusion zone receiving significant doses of radiation. There are unconfirmed reports that some are being treated in Belarus. Reuters news agency quoted workers at the plant as saying some of the soldiers had no idea they were in a radiation zone. The Russian military however said that after capturing the plant radiation levels at the plant itself had stayed within a normal range. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a statement that it was unable to confirm the reports. The head of Ukraines agency in charge of the exclusion zone Yevhen Kramarenko said that radiation levels appeared to be normal and there was no indication of significant damage. However as the sensors for detecting radiation levels were not working staff needed to check the facilities he added. The head of the IAEA said it was in close consultations with Ukrainian authorities on sending a mission to the Chernobyl plant very very soon. While Chernobyl is a word that evokes apocalypse nuclear experts stressed throughout this saga that there was no risk of another Chernobyl. There is no working nuclear reactor on the site. As Prof Claire Corkhill from Sheffield University told me at the time even if buildings containing contaminated material were pierced we wouldn\t be talking about plumes of radioactive smoke. She was much more concerned when Russian forces attacked a building at the working Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility on 4 March. That incident caused the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to plan a trip to Ukraine - essentially to ask Russian forces to keep nuclear facilities out of the line of fire. What is a concern in Chernobyl now Prof Corkhill told me is that we haven\t had regular communication between the site and the IAEA which basically keeps a safety log] of where any potentially hazardous material is. We now need to go in and establish that none of that material is missing. Other scientists are concerned about the damage that may have been caused to a place that has become a wildlife refuge and a site of international research collaboration. Prof Nick Beresford who studies the exclusion zone\s landscape says his Ukrainian colleagues now don\t know if they will have labs to return to. The zone itself over the last nearly 40 years has become a site for wildlife he added. Lots of rare species moved in when people moved out. We just don\t know how this will have affected the wildlife. In recent days Russia has said it will scale down its operations in northern Ukraine around the capital Kyiv and focus its forces on the eastern Donbas region. Chernobyl is located north of Kyiv. But on Thursday Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Moscow was repositioning rather than withdrawing in order to regroup resupply and reinforce its offensive in Donbas. At the same time Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities. So we can expect additional offensive actions bringing even more suffering he said. There was no change in Russias objective to pursue a military outcome he added. The occupation of the Chernobyl site since 24 February the day of the invasion has been dogged with concerns about power outages and problems for the staff many of whom were trapped there for weeks and could not get home. Although no longer a working power station Chernobyl was never fully abandoned and still requires constant management. How close was nuclear plant attack to catastrophe? Chernobyl workers ordeal under Russian guard It is the site of what is considered to be the worlds worst nuclear accident in 1986. The Russian withdrawal follows an announcement several days ago by the mayor of Slavutych a nearby town housing workers at the plant that Russian troops had left the town.

Ukraine war: Russian forces regrouping for attack - Nato,"The UK says Russia is bringing in between 1,200 and 2,000 troops from Georgia as reinforcements.",Ukraine war: Russian forces regrouping for attack - Nato Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption A man rides past a destroyed Russian tank in Trostyanets north-east Ukraine Russian forces in Ukraine are regrouping to double down on their attacks in the east of the country according to Natos secretary general. Russia is trying to regroup resupply and reinforce Jens Stoltenberg said. The UK said Russia was bringing in between 1200 and 2000 of its Russian troops from Georgia as reinforcements. Moscow said on Tuesday that it would reduce military activity in northern Ukraine and focus on liberating the Donbas region in the south-east. Mr Stoltenberg said Russias aim of pursuing a military outcome had not changed. We see continued shelling of cities and we see that Russia is re-positioning some of the troops moving some of them around most likely to reinforce their efforts in the Donbas region he said. At the same time Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities. So we can expect additional offensive actions bringing even more suffering. Russian shelling continuing as ground troops regroup Putin advisers too scared to tell him truth - US Ukraine sends buses to Mariupol for rescue efforts Echoing Mr Stoltenberg\s remarks the UK\s Defence Secretary Ben Wallace warned that Russia\s change in tactics was not a retreat. The UK also said bringing in Russian troops from breakaway areas of Georgia had not been part of Moscows original plan. It is highly unlikely that Russia planned to generate reinforcements in this manner and it is indicative of the unexpected losses it has sustained during the invasion the defence ministry tweeted. Around 20% of Russian troops around Kyiv have started to reposition according to a US senior defence official. The official added that the Russians had largely abandoned Hostomel airport outside of Kyiv and are also moving away from the Chernobyl nuclear plant. But they said Russia was keeping the pressure on in the air with air strikes continuing to fall on the cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv in the north. Bombs are also falling on towns and cities in the south which is becoming the key battlefront according to Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko cited by Reuters news agency. On Thursday evening Ukraines air force appealed for more support from Western countries saying it was operating outdated equipment that was no match for Russias more advanced systems had sustained losses and urgently needed modern fighter jets and air defence systems. The air force urged provision of F-15 or F-16 fighter jets which it said had the same advanced technology as the latest Russian fighter jets. Previous discussions had centred around Poland providing Russian-made Mig-29s but the plan was eventually dropped. It also called for the US Patriot or Norwegian Nasams missile systems. Truth: Air superiority is the deciding factor in this war. Air superiority has played a key role in all wars since WWII Ukraine\s air force tweeted. Russia concentrating efforts in Donbas Though US intelligence reports say Russian troops have not made much progress in the east since the invasion began Russia has said it will now concentrate its efforts on liberating the region. The region is home to the self-declared and Russian-backed peoples republics of Luhansk and Donetsk which are part of Ukraine but which Russia recognised as independent three days before invading. But Ukrainian troops have stymied and frustrated Russia\s progress in the region said the US defence intelligence official. They added it remains to be seen whether the refitting and repositioning of troops will make a difference. But that this could mean the conflict is lengthy and more drawn out.

Ukraine war: Gruesome evidence points to war crimes on road outside Kyiv,The BBC finds the charred remains of civilians on a highway where Russian troops had stationed tanks.,Ukraine war: Gruesome evidence points to war crimes on road outside Kyiv Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE JEREMY BOWEN Image caption Corpses and burned out cars litter this stretch of the E-40 highway Footage of Russian troops shooting a man with his hands up on a highway outside Kyiv at the beginning of March was shared around the world. Now the Russians have been pushed out of the area and the BBCs Jeremy Bowen has been to see the grim aftermath of their short-lived occupation. This report contains material some viewers will find disturbing We counted 13 bodies on a nightmarish stretch of road not much more than 200 yards long between Mria and Myla villages whose Ukrainian names translate as Dream and Sweetheart. Two of the dead are confirmed as Ukrainian civilians who were killed by the Russians. The others have not been identified yet - they lie where they were killed - but only two are wearing recognisable Ukrainian military uniforms. Our BBC team was able to get to the area on the main E-40 highway as it approaches Kyiv because Ukrainian forces had captured the sector only 10 hours earlier. The marks of battle and of heavy shelling were everywhere. Petrol stations and a hotel that was well-known for its spa and restaurant were in ruins. Shell holes and craters pockmarked both carriageways. Ukrainian troops changing a wheel in the ruins of a roadside garage said the Russians were about 4km (2.5 miles) away and had pulled their remaining men and armour back after a hard fight lasting several days in the early hours of the morning. Warning: Graphic video ahead Left behind in the heart of the desolation were the dead bodies and a mass of questions and concerns about who they were and how they died. Media caption Watch: Jeremy Bowen finds bodies on a road Russians occupied outside Kyiv Some answers already exist for a couple who were killed by the Russians and left to decompose on 7 March. Their rusty shrapnel riddled car lies in the road next to one of the petrol stations reduced to a shell by fire. Next to it are the burnt and twisted remains of a body that is just about recognisable as the remains of a man. A wedding ring is still on the corpses finger. Stretched out inside the hulk of their car is what is left of the incinerated body of a woman the mouth opened in what looks like a scream. Their deaths were filmed by a Ukrainian drone on 7 March operated by the Bugatti unit of Territorial Defence. The unit released the video which was republished by news organisations around the world. It caused outrage because it showed the cold-blooded killing of a man who had raised his arms to show he was harmless in the classic gesture of surrender. The bodies the BBC discovered in an investigation this month are of Maksim Iowenko and his wife Ksjena. They were part of a convoy of 10 civilian vehicles who were trying to escape the Russians and get to Kyiv. IMAGE SOURCE SUPPLIED Image caption Ksjena and Maksim Iowenko were civilians and should have been protected As they drove down the road they spotted a Russian tank in position dug into the grass verge. The drone video shows it was clearly marked with the letter V one of the identifiers used by the Russian armed forces. The other cars did quick U-turns and drove away at speed. But Maksims car stopped most likely because it was hit. As soon as the car stopped Maksim leapt out and raised his hands. Within seconds he was shot dead. His wife was killed in the car. Also in the car were their six-year-old son and the elderly mother of one of Maksims friends. Both of them survived and were eventually released by the Russian soldiers. They were found walking back down the road and the woman told her family that Maksim was shouting that a child was in the car when he was killed. Both survivors according to the Bugatti drone unit are now safe but deeply traumatised. Warning: Graphic images ahead The car is now burnt out but it was not on fire after the attack. One hypothesis must be that the bodies and the car were set on fire by the Russians to destroy the evidence of what they had done. The Bugatti Unit has submitted its drone video to the Ukrainian authorities and to the Metropolitan Police in London. More burnt cars and dead bodies line the road for the next few hundred yards. No video has emerged to show what happened. A credible working assumption for any investigation must be that the other dead people were killed by the tank crew or other Russian soldiers. IMAGE SOURCE JEREMY BOWEN Image caption Some of the evidence the BBC gathered is too disturbing to show in full. Here a dead man has been covered by rubber tyres IMAGE SOURCE JEREMY BOWEN Image caption Here a Ukrainian soldier gestures towards sets of charred human remains by a burned out vehicle Attempts have been made to destroy the other bodies. Some have been left to rot where they were killed. But other corpses have been piled up and surrounded by tyres. Charred clothing indicates attempts were made to set fires around them. Tyres are flammable and must have been placed there as an accelerant. The emplacement where the tank was dug in has a clear arc of fire across the area where the 13 bodies are lying. The tank has gone but debris was left by its crew including Russian army field rations. In the woods nearby is at least one other tank which has been burnt out after being hit by an anti-tank missile. A Ukrainian soldier produced a wallet he had found in the tank. He emptied out Russian identity papers bank notes in the Russian currency the rouble and small change in Belorussian coppers. The major thrust to the north-west of Kyiv came from invaders who had crossed the border from Belarus Moscows ally. Close by the knocked out tank are the remains of a chaotic camp with dugouts chairs and a long table piled high with the remains of food and drink. They are all surrounded by big piles of garbage rotten food and empty bottles of alcohol. Ukrainian soldiers said shops at the petrol stations were looted. Image caption An abandoned Russian camp: the soldiers are said to have looted petrol stations Next to the table is a large pair of bolt-cutters. Piles of unburied rubbish scattered in a forward position are usually a sign of undisciplined soldiers. We decided to drive two or three kilometres further down the road after Ukrainian soldiers said more Russian armour had been destroyed. In a small village a Russian tank and two armoured personnel carriers were broken and burnt. Some of the wreckage was still smoking. The force of the weapon that destroyed the tank blew off its turret and main gun which lay upside down and half buried in a crater around 15 yards away. In the pine woods on either side of the road Ukrainian soldiers were digging trenches and fox holes with shovels. Others were patrolling. It was far too early to say whether the Russians were gone for good or whether they would be back. What is clear though is that Russian forces under continued pressure from Ukrainian soldiers have been forced to yield strategic territory around Kyiv. Every time they move back the Ukrainian capital and its people become a little safer. Media caption Video captured by a Ukrainian aerial reconnaissance group appears to show Russian forces shooting at civilians As and when the Russians leave more evidence is likely to emerge of civilians having been killed - backing up the many stories that have emerged of such incidents. The gruesome scenes on the road were more than simply the terrible deaths of human beings who had become victims of President Putins decision to invade. It is also a crime scene with evidence that should be collected and preserved for an investigation whenever this war ends. Under the laws of war civilians are protected and when they are killed in defiance of those laws their deaths amount to war crimes.

Moscow said it would drastically reduce its military operations in two key areas of Ukraine to boost mutual trust in the talks which are being held in Istanbul. But while the decision to scale back operations around the capital Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv was the first sign of tangible progress many questions remain unanswered. Its unclear how extensive any reduction in military activity might be. The US has expressed scepticism too - noting how Russia has already refocused its military campaign on Ukraines east. Ukraine\s President Volodymyr Zelensky was more forthright saying positive signals from the talks did not drown out the explosions or Russian shells. The talks also featured an appearance from Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich - hours after reports emerged suggesting he had suffered suspected poisoning symptoms at peace talks earlier this month.

Image caption Stills from a video claiming to show mistreatment of Russian prisoners Ukrainian authorities are investigating video footage which has been said to show Ukrainian soldiers shooting Russian prisoners in the legs. The grainy video has been circulating on social media after first appearing in the early hours of Sunday. Since then its been widely reposted by pro-Russian accounts on various platforms. Ukrainian armed forces Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi said Russia was filming and distributing staged videos in order to discredit Ukraine\s treatment of Russian prisoners. However Oleksiy Arestovych an adviser to President Zelensky said there would be an immediate investigation and added: I would like to remind all our military civilians and defence forces that abusing prisoners of war is a war crime. The BBC has been analysing the video but has not yet been able to independently verify it. Heres what weve found out so far. Odesa defies Russia and embraces signs of life IMAGE SOURCE BBC NEWS In the south Ukrainian forces have had some success in pushing back Russian forces - raising doubts over whether Moscow will still try to seize control of the whole coastline. The BBCs Andrew Harding has been in the strategic port city of Odesa where the immediate fear of Russian bombardment has eased. But people there are unsure whether it is just a temporary lull in the fighting. The historic and cosmopolitan resort city is gently trying to reconnect with its famously relaxed holiday spirit as if embracing it were a form of defiance against the Kremlin. The recent reopening of clubs beach restaurants and nail salons across Odesa also reflects growing local confidence in the course of the war against Russia at least here on the Black Sea coast.

Pop superstars like Ed Sheeran Camila Cabello and Emeli Sande were among the artists at the Concert For Ukraine. Jamala gave an impassioned rendition of her Eurovision-winning track 1944. And the stories of two Ukrainians were put centre stage when they were read by actors Tamsin Greig and Eddie Marsan. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Ed Sheeran joined Camila Cabello on stage for their duet Bam Bam Scottish violinist Nicola Benedetti accompanied the actors as they delivered the harrowing accounts of fleeing the Russian invasion. Friday Night Dinner actress Greig read the words of Natalya who spent three days sheltering in a basement in Kharkiv before leaving on an overcrowded train later finding out her apartment block and university had been destroyed. Then Marsan voiced the words of Artem who spent four days travelling to Romania with his traumatised children. Benedettis haunting performance merged seamlessly with a viral video of Ukrainian violinist Illia Bondarenko playing a folk song while sheltering in a basement accompanied virtually by 94 other violinists from around the world. That segment provided a sobering perspective on a night when some of the biggest names in music delivered performances that ranged from the sombre to the uplifting. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Jamala held the Ukrainian flag during her performance Jamala received one of the loudest cheers of the night when she held up the Ukrainian flag that she had been holding throughout her performance. The singer herself fled Kyiv with her children at the start of the war. It was really hard but I am here she told ITV beforehand. Thank you so much to all musicians for supporting Ukraine for standing with Ukraine because it\s really important for us. Her song 1944 was inspired by her great-grandmother who was among thousands of Tatars who were forcibly deported from Crimea by Russian dictator Joseph Stalin during World War Two. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Broadcaster Sir Trevor McDonald paid tribute to the journalists reporting on the war in Ukraine Lyrics about fighting against all odds took on a new resonance as Sheeran performed his hit Perfect.

He then joined Cuban-American superstar Camila Cabello to perform their duet Bam Bam live for the first time. She said: We\re all praying tonight for the peace and the safety of the people in the Ukraine. Thank you guys so much for being a part of this super-important fundraiser. Singer-songwriter Tom Odell performed his ballad Another Love which has become adopted as an anthem of solidarity among Ukrainians on social media. Welsh rock band The Manic Street Preachers resurrected their 1998 number one single If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next - a message that originally appeared on a recruiting poster for international volunteers to fight fascists during the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Nile Rodgers suit was in the colours of the Ukrainian flag Nile Rodgers Snow Patrol Anne-Marie Becky Hill Gregory Porter Paloma Faith and the Kingdom Choir also appeared some with blue and yellow backdrops on screens and performing next to piles of sunflowers. There was also a recorded message from US star Billie Eilish and brother and collaborator Finneas O\Connell who sent their support and solidarity. The event was broadcast live on ITV and STV. As well as millions of pounds of public donations the broadcasters donated an estimated £3m of advertising revenue. Another £250000 was generated by ticket sales. The funds will go to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC)s humanitarian appeal. The event was organised in three weeks by Guy Freeman from Livewire Pictures who told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that the artists and others from the music and TV industries had not hesitated to donate their time. Everybody was just so affected by those daily pictures of refugees displaced people leaving everything behind and us all feeling helpless he said. And so this is what I guess we in the live events and TV industry can do - something like this to try and help. Popular Ukrainian band Antytila whose members have become soldiers and volunteers during the war had posted a video showing them in military uniforms offering to perform in a live link-up from Kyiv. However organisers said they could not include them as we are only able to focus on the humanitarian situation not the politics or the military conflict. Antytila drummer Dmitriy Vodovozov told BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday: I don\t agree with it because we are living in war now and everything is political to us.]

"Ukraine war: Russia blocks buses heading to Mariupol, says Ukraine","Russia has blocked 45 buses heading to the city to rescue civilians, says Ukraine's deputy prime minister.",Ukraine war: Russia blocks buses heading to Mariupol says Ukraine Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Russian forces have been besieging Mariupol for weeks Fresh efforts are under way to evacuate civilians trapped by Russian forces in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said a convoy of 45 Ukrainian buses was on its way to the besieged southern city. She said the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had confirmed that Russia had agreed to open a humanitarian corridor to Mariupol. Tens of thousands of civilians remain there after weeks of bombardment. Ms Vereshchuk also accused Russian troops of blocking the bus convoy at a checkpoint near Vasylivka three hours drive from Mariupol earlier in the day. The Russian Federation again does not let our buses pass she told Ukrainian news agency Unian. The Russian defence ministry said the United Nations refugee agency and the Red Cross would assist in the evacuation of civilians. The evacuation was initially planned for Thursday but the Red Cross has since told Reuters that for logistical and security reasons the evacuation will now happen on Friday. It said a ceasefire would allow people to travel westwards to Zaporizhzhia via the Russian-controlled port of Berdyansk. A spokesperson for the ICRC said its teams were ready to help get civilians out of Mariupol from Friday but only if all parties agreed on the terms. It\s desperately important that this operation takes place. The lives of tens of thousands of people in Mariupol depend on it the spokesperson added. The BBC has spoken to people who have managed to leave the besieged port city in the last few weeks. All of them described a city in ruins with entire districts completely flattened. Diana Yalovets a 23-year-old student said: As we tried to get out we needed to cross the city centre. It was scary to see destroyed streets and buildings. My school was destroyed. It\s painful to see your once beautiful city this way. Mariupol was a safe city. We loved to walk near the sea. There was a park and it was an amazing place just to sit and talk. I just can\t believe we lost everything we had. Although some residents have escaped all previous attempts to establish a ceasefire in Mariupol have collapsed amid accusations of bad faith from both sides. Russia has also been accused of forcibly relocating thousands of civilians to Russia or Russian-controlled areas. Capturing the city would give Russia control of the Azov Sea coastline between Russia and Crimea. The announcement of a truce follows a telephone call on Tuesday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. During the conversation Mr Putin said that shelling of Mariupol would not end until Ukrainian troops surrendered.

Ukraine war: Russia threatens to stop supplying gas if not paid in roubles,"Vladimir Putin orders ""unfriendly"" foreign buyers of Russia's gas to open Russian bank accounts.",Ukraine war: Russia threatens to stop supplying gas if not paid in roubles By Michael Race Business reporter BBC News Published 2 days ago comments Comments Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Russia has told unfriendly foreign countries they must start paying for gas in roubles or it will cut supplies. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree stating buyers must open rouble accounts in Russian banks from Friday. Nobody sells us anything for free and we are not going to do charity either - that is existing contracts will be stopped the Russian president said. Mr Putins demand is being seen as an attempt to boost the rouble which has been hit by Western sanctions. His decree means foreign buyers of Russian gas would have to open an account at Russias Gazprombank and transfer euros or US dollars into it. Gazprombank would then convert this into roubles which will then be used to make the payment for gas. Though the order comes into effect for gas exported from Friday onwards the payments for that gas will not be paid by European buyers until mid-May Dr Jack Sharples a research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies told the BBC. That suggests there may not be an immediate threat to supplies. Mr Putin said the switch to roubles was meant to strengthen Russias sovereignty and it would stick to its obligations on all contracts if Western nations obliged. Germany said the change announced by Mr Putin amounted to blackmail. Since Russia invaded Ukraine Western nations have issued economic and trading sanctions on Russia but the European Union has not placed bans on oil or gas unlike the US and Canada as its member nations rely heavily on it. The EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia and has no easy substitutes if supplies are disrupted. Meanwhile Russia currently gets €400m (£340m) per day from gas sales to the bloc and it has no way of rerouting this supply to other markets. For the Kremlin this is designed to suggest a dramatic escalation in the economic battle between the West and Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has outlined a pathway for the cutting of gas supplies to Europe if Western customers refuse to pay for supplies in the Russian currency the rouble. However the market reaction suggests the details of the mechanism mean that in practice European customers will just have to change their currency dealers to Gazprombank. That bank has already been left unsanctioned by the EU for the purpose of continuity of energy trade. As a result gas prices remain very high but did not today shoot into the stratosphere. There should be a workaround. As one leading analyst told me this solution has saved face for Putin who can sound tough on domestic TV. Ultimately as Russian officials have repeatedly said for decades Russian supply of energy to the West continued uninterrupted even during the height of the Cold War. Ultimately Russia still needs the money for the gas and still wants to leave the possibility of a market for its main export once a peace deal is signed. However it is also true to say that the threat of a cut-off has escalated. EU nations have prepared emergency measures to manage demand and would be more willing to face that now during spring and summer than winter. The net effect of the mechanism announced is to limit the ability of the West to freeze the revenues they pay to Gazprom which Putin described as receiving the gas for free. Some Ukrainian officials have suggested such an approach. Oil and gas dollars and euros continue to help the Kremlin resist an otherwise tough set of financial sanctions. Major potential escalation Analysts said Russia halting gas flows to EU member countries to force the issue would mark a major escalation not even performed at the height of the Cold War. It would mark another major financial blow to Russia\s coffers the analysts at Fitch Solutions added. It is also unclear whether Russias new payment mechanism for gas would fully ban payments in euros. Western companies and governments have rejected Russias demands to pay for gas in roubles as a breach of existing contracts which are set in euros or US dollars. Germany and Austria take step towards gas rationing Russia to allow unauthorised imports from West German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said German companies would continue to pay for Russian gas using euros as stipulated in contracts. Nathan Piper head of oil and gas research at Investec told the BBC the move by Mr Putin was an attempt to put economic pressure back on Europe and that more foreign exchange demand for roubles would likely push up the value of the currency. However long term Russia needs to remain a reliable supplier of gas so it is unclear if they would actually restrict gas supply he added. That said even the risk of it is keeping UK/European gas prices at near record highs and six times the 10-year average. This is translating to steep rises in consumers\ energy bills. IMAGE SOURCE AFP Image caption The Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline was inaugurated just over a decade ago between Russia and Germany Dr Sharples of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said the two sides could adapt and continue their trade uninterrupted or one or both parties could claim breach of contract and escalate the situation. One would hope that even if the situation escalated to a point where one or both parties call for arbitration that the gas would continue to flow. However a stoppage cannot be ruled out he said. Germany and Austria trigger emergency plans Germany which gets about half its gas and a third of its oil from Russia has urged its citizens and companies to reduce consumption in anticipation of possible shortages. Austria which imports about 40% of its gas from Russia is tightening its monitoring of the market. Under an existing gas emergency plan the early warning phase which both Germany and Austria have begun is the first of three steps designed to prepare the country for a potential supply shortage. In its final stage the governments would bring in gas rationing. Elsewhere Bulgaria which gets 90% of its gas via imports from Russian company Gazprom has opened a tender for underground drilling as part of plans to almost double the countrys gas storage capacity and prepare for any supply disruptions. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases. The UK government said it was not planning to pay for Russian gas in roubles.]

"Ukraine war: Putin being misled by fearful advisers, US says","News on Russia's poor military performance is not making it back to Putin, the White House says.",Ukraine war: Putin being misled by fearful advisers US says Published 3 days ago comments Comments Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption The US and UK say Putin is being misinformed by his advisers Russian President Vladimir Putin is being misled by advisers who are too scared to tell him how badly the war in Ukraine is going the White House says. Meanwhile British intelligence says Russian troops in Ukraine are demoralised short of equipment and refusing to carry out orders. Mr Putin is also not being told about the full impact of sanctions on the Russian economy the White House said. The Kremlin said the US had a total misunderstanding of the situation. Mr Putin\s chief spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists: They simply don\t understand what\s happening in the Kremlin they don\t understand President Putin they don\t understand how decisions are taken and they don\t understand the style of our work. This was worrying he added because such total misunderstanding leads to wrong decisions which have bad consequences. Earlier White House spokesperson Kate Bedingfield said the US had information that Mr Putin felt misled by the Russian military and this had resulted in persistent tension between Putin and his military leadership. Putin\s war has been a strategic blunder that has left Russia weaker over the long term and increasingly isolated on the world stage she said. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby called the assessments discomforting because an uninformed Putin could result in a less than faithful effort at ending the conflict through peace negotiations. The other thing is you don\t know how a leader like that is going to react to getting bad news he said. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption People are continuing to be evacuated from Irpin where Ukraine says it has pushed Russia back Ukrainian forces have begun attempts to retake some areas from Russia which on Tuesday said it would scale back operations around Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv. Jeremy Fleming the head of the UK\s cyber-intelligence agency GCHQ said the move added to indications Russia had massively misjudged the situation and had been forced to significantly rethink. We\ve seen Russian soldiers - short of weapons and morale - refusing to carry out orders sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft Mr Fleming said in a speech to the Australian National University in Canberra. And even though Putin\s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth what\s going on and the extent of these misjudgements must be crystal clear to the regime. On the ground US and Ukrainian officials say Russia is continuing to reposition forces away from Kyiv probably as part of its effort to refocus on eastern regions. In other developments: President Volodymyr Zelensky cast doubt on Russia\s claims it was de-escalating calling it the precursor to new strikes in the eastern Donbas region. We don\t believe anyone. Not a single beautiful word he said Russias defence ministry proposed a one-day ceasefire in besieged Mariupol on Thursday to let people leave. This came after Mr Putin said Mariupol would have to surrender to stop the shelling A US defence official said some Russian troops were leaving the Chernobyl area - home to a former nuclear plant that was the site of the world\s worst nuclear accident in 1986 - and heading to neighbouring Belarus. We think that they are leaving I can\t tell you that they\re all gone the official said Four million Ukrainians have fled the country and a quarter of the population has been displaced French military intelligence chief Gen Éric Vidaud has been dismissed from his post for not predicting the Russian invasion French media report Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine are due to restart online on 1 April according to Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia. In an online post cited by Reuters Mr Arakhamia said Ukraine had proposed the leaders of both countries meet but Russia declined saying more work was needed on a draft treaty. Mr Zelensky meanwhile characterised the talks as only words no specifics yet following a similarly downbeat assessment from Russia.

Ukraine war: How reliant is the world on Russia for oil and gas?,Russia has threatened to cut off gas supplies if countries ban its oil.,Ukraine war: How reliant is the world on Russia for oil and gas? By Jake Horton Daniele Palumbo & Tim Bowler BBC Reality Check Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Fuel prices have soared since Russias invasion of Ukraine President Vladimir Putin has threatened to cut gas supplies to unfriendly countries if they don\t start paying for gas imports in Russian roubles. The US EU and UK placed restrictions on oil and gas imports from Russia after it invaded Ukraine in February. What sanctions are there on Russian oil and gas? The US has declared a complete ban on Russian oil gas and coal imports. The UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year and the EU is reducing its Russian gas imports by two-thirds. The UK government says this allows enough time for it to find alternative supplies. Deputy Russian Prime Minister Alexander Novak has said rejecting Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market. Oil and gas prices have risen since the invasion of Ukraine and if Russia were to halt exports they could rise further. What would happen if Russian gas stopped flowing into Europe? Heating prices - which are already high - would increase even more. Russian gas accounts for about 40% of the EUs natural gas imports. If this dried up Italy and Germany would be especially vulnerable. Europe could turn to existing gas exporters such Qatar Algeria or Nigeria but there are practical obstacles to quickly expanding production. Russia only provides about 5% of the UKs gas supplies and the US doesnt import any Russian gas. Gas prices in Europe the UK (and to a lesser extent the US) jumped significantly after the invasion due to worries about supply shortages although they then fell back. Could alternatives to Russian gas be found? The US has agreed to ship an additional 15 billion cubic metres of liquified natural gas (LNG) to Europe by the end of this year. The aim is to supply 50 billion cubic metres per year of additional gas until at least 2030. But energy policy research analyst Ben McWilliams says its not very easy to substitute the gas that flows from Russia. It\s harder to substitute gas because we have these big pipes that are taking Russian gas to Europe says Mr McWilliams. Europe could also ramp up the use of other energy sources but doing so is not quick or easy. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption The EU hopes to massively boost its use of renewable energy including wind power Renewables take time to roll out so in the short term this is not a solution says research analyst Simone Tagliapietra. So for next winter - what can make a difference is fuel switching such as opening up coal-fired power plants as Italy and Germany have plans to do in case of an emergency. The EU has proposed a plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels before 2030 - including measures to diversify gas supplies and replace gas in heating and power generation. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline and the Ukraine crisis IEA: Green energy needed to avoid turbulent prices How much oil does Russia export? Russia is the third biggest producer of oil in the world behind the US and Saudi Arabia. Of about five million barrels of crude oil it exports each day more than half of that goes to Europe. Russian imports account for 8% of total UK oil demand. The US is less reliant with about 3% of its imported oil coming from Russia in 2020. What about alternative oil supplies? Mr McWilliams says it should be easier to find alternative suppliers for oil than for gas because while some comes from Russia there\s also a lot of shipments from elsewhere. US President Joe Biden has ordered a major release of oil from Americas strategic reserves in an effort to bring down high fuel costs. The US has been asking Saudi Arabia to increase its oil production but it has rebuffed previous US requests to boost output in order to reduce oil prices. Saudi Arabia is the biggest producer in Opec the oil cartel which accounts for about 60% of the crude oil traded internationally. Because of this Opec has a key role in influencing oil prices. So far no Opec member has agreed to any requests to boost output. Russia is not in Opec but has been working with it since 2017 to place limits on oil production in order to maintain earnings for producers. The US is also looking at relaxing Venezuelas oil sanctions. It used to be a key US oil supplier but recently Venezuela has largely been selling its oil to China. What will happen to my heating and fuel bills? Consumers will face rising energy and fuel bills as a result of this war. In the UK household energy bills have been kept in check by an energy price cap. But bills will rise by £700 to about £2000 in April when the cap is increased. They are expected to reach about £3000 when the cap is increased again this autumn. UK petrol and diesel prices have also soared and the government has now announced a cut in fuel duty as motorists struggle with record prices. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Heating bills are set to rise sharply this year in the UK I think if we\re in a world where Russian oil and gas stop flowing to Europe then we\re going to need rationing-style measures says Mr McWilliams. Part of the conversation now is can we tell households to turn their thermostats down one degree which can save a significant chunk of gas.

The first phase of the Homes for Ukraine scheme will see about 30 evacuees arriving in each of the countys seven districts over the next few weeks. It is part of the governments plan to house people escaping the war-torn country with host families in the UK. Charities say the application process is too difficult for those fleeing The latest government figures show that there have been 2700 visas issued for refugees coming to the UK as part of Homes for Ukraine - fewer than 10% of the 28300 applications made in the first 15 days. Under the scheme hosts and guests are required to find each other and make a match before either side can then make the necessary visa application. Lord Harrington refugees minister has admitted the forms took too long to fill in and said the government was trying to speed up the process. Hearts and homes According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service potential hosts will now have their homes checked by local councils to ensure they are suitable. Richard Wright Conservative leader of North Kesteven District Council and county representative on the regional migration board thanked people who has who had offered up their hearts and homes. Lincolnshire is clearly standing ready to welcome as many evacuating Ukrainians as we are able to and to offer the levels of support necessary to assist them and their sponsoring hosts in settling into their new circumstances at a pace that respects their need for time and space he said. Hosts are being supported by the Lincolnshire Resettlement Partnership which expects more arrivals over the coming months. Earlier this month Sir Edward Leigh Conservative MP for Gainsborough was criticised over comments he made during a debate on Ukraine when he said the county had done our bit on immigration from Eastern Europe adding that migration had already led to extreme pressure in terms of housing and jobs. He later claimed his comments were misinterpreted or taken out of context. Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook Twitter and Instagram.

Ukraine war: Mariupol's refugees carry wounds of battered city,Residents who have escaped the besieged city are trying to leave behind memories of its destruction.,Ukraine war: Mariupols refugees carry wounds of battered city By Lucy Williamson BBC News Lviv Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption Mariupol residents Yevgen and Natalia have made it to Lviv in western Ukraine There is no humanitarian corridor now out of Mariupol. Just a trickle of people gambling on Russian military checkpoints - and Russian political whim. But getting out of the besieged southern city is only the first challenge; the other is leaving it behind when you do. Alexander was brought to an Israeli field hospital near Lviv last week catatonic. His 24-year-old brain was stuck on the horror hed lived through: on the Russian rockets that hit the apartment block where he was staying with his parents; on the rubble and dead bodies they ran through without even putting on their shoes. It was constant bombing says his father Yevgen. Planes went past every 10 minutes and dropped bombs on Mariupol. People were falling and dying in front of my eyes. We buried people in gardens. The family found shelter with hundreds of others in a cinema near the city centre. Trapped there by Russian attacks they survived on scraps of food from locals or Ukrainian soldiers boiling snow to drink. Image caption The family are staying with friends outside Lviv after fleeing Mariupol When supplies ran critically low Natalia says everyone without young children was asked to leave - to save resources and give the children a chance. We had a car that was damaged but still working she said so we decided to leave the shelter. There was no way out: you could stay and die or you could go and die. You couldn\t even count minutes between the bombs. Memories like these mask their old lives like a second skin. The destruction and damage to Mariupol is carried out of the city with them; invisible shrapnel lodged in their minds. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Some 160000 people are still thought to be trapped in Mariupol Mariupols mayor says 5000 people have been killed and 90% of the buildings damaged. Some of their pro-Russian neighbours Natalia says believed it was Ukrainian forces pounding their city to dust. She refers to the Russian soldiers sarcastically as our saviours or those charming boys describing the pressure tactics she saw them use. After the shelling those \handsome boys\ would appear and try to hand out sweets she said. Some people couldn\t resist taking them because they hadn\t eaten for several days. When you\re suffering like that you\ll take anything. Image caption Natalia says they were told to flee when resources ran low Some 160000 people are thought to still be trapped inside the city. France Greece and Turkey have all tried to push for a pause in the attacks to get aid in and allow civilians to leave. But Russias President Putin has said Mariupol must surrender in order for the bombardment to stop. Alexander and his family are now staying with friends outside Lviv. And Alexander has just been discharged and allowed to go home. His father Yevgen is a musician with one remaining saxophone he salvaged from the city before he left. Before taking his son home from hospital he gave staff at the hospital a concert Alexander smiling on beside him. Gathered between the medical tents to listen half the doctors were in tears. They listened to the beautiful sound from the man who had lost so much but who stood there giving thanks for what he saved from Mariupol: his saxophone and his son.

Ukraine War: Putin demands Mariupol surrender to end shelling,Russia's defence ministry has since proposed a one-day ceasefire on Thursday to let civilians leave.,Ukraine War: Putin demands Mariupol surrender to end shelling Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that shelling of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol will only end when Ukrainian troops surrender. Mr Putin made the comments during an hour long phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday night the Kremlin said in a statement. But French officials said the Russian leader had agreed to consider plans to evacuate civilians from the city. Russia later proposed a one-day ceasefire for Thursday. The defence ministry said the ceasefire would start at 10:00 local time (08:00 BST) and would allow people to travel westwards to Zaporizhzhia via the Russian-controlled port of Berdyansk. On Thursday morning Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said a convoy of Ukrainian buses was on its way to Mariupol to try to evacuate civilians. She said the International Committee of the Red Cross had confirmed that Russia had agreed to open a humanitarian corridor to the city. Previous attempts to establish a ceasefire in Mariupol have collapsed amid accusations of bad faith from both sides. Russia has also been accused of forcibly relocating thousands of civilians to Russia or Russian-controlled areas. The announcement comes as new satellite photos showed the destruction caused by the shelling. The images released by the Earth observation company Maxar showed that residential areas have been reduced to rubble and highlighted Russian artillery cannons in firing positions on the outskirts of the city. IMAGE SOURCE MAXAR Officials from France\s Elyseé palace called the situation in the city catastrophic and added that civilian populations must be protected and must leave the city if they wish to. They must have access to food aid water and the medicines they need. This very degraded humanitarian situation is linked to the siege of the city by the Russian armed forces the statement said. France along with Turkey Greece and several humanitarian groups have presented Mr Putin with a plan to evacuate the city. Officials said that Mr Putin told Mr Macron that he will think about the proposal. But in its readout of the call the Kremlin appeared to suggest that Mr Putin has provided no such assurances. Russian officials said Mr Putin told the French leader that in order to resolve the difficult humanitarian situation in this city Ukrainian nationalist militants must stop resisting and lay down their arms. The statement added that Mr Putin had given Mr Macron detailed information about measures taken by the Russian military to provide emergency humanitarian assistance and ensure the safe evacuation of civilians from the besieged south-eastern city. Ukraine has accused Russia of forcibly relocating thousands of people from Mariupol to Russian-held territory. IMAGE SOURCE MAXAR Image caption Russian artillery positions on the periphery of Mariupol The call followed claims by the mayor of Mariupol that thousands of people have been killed during the Russian bombardment of the port city. Vadym Boychenko who has been evacuated from the city told the Reuters news agency that almost 5000 people including around 210 children have been killed since Russian shelling began. Matilda Bogner the head of the UN human rights mission in Ukraine told Reuters that she believes there could be thousands of deaths civilian casualties in Mariupol. The International Red Cross humanitarian organisation has confirmed reports that one of its warehouses in the city has been hit by Russian shelling telling the BBC that all supplies in the depot had already been distributed. It added that it no longer has a team on the ground and therefore could not comment on potential extent of casualties or damage. Are you or your family in Mariupol?

Russia said on Tuesday it would cut back operations around Chernihiv and the capital Kyiv in an effort to boost mutual trust in peace talks. But the Chernihiv regions governor told the BBC attacks had continued overnight into Wednesday. Ukraine also said there had been no mass removal of troops. Oleksandr Motuzyanyk a spokesperson for Ukraines armed forces said that though there had been a partial movement of troops from the directions of Kyiv and Chernihiv they had yet to fully abandon attempts to seize or at least surround these cities. Later on Wednesday a US defence official said some Russian troops were leaving the Chernobyl area - home to a former nuclear plant that was the site of the worlds worst nuclear accident in 1986. Chernobyl is an] area where they are beginning to reposition some of their troops - leaving walking away from the Chernobyl facility and moving into Belarus the official said. We think that they are leaving I can\t tell you that they\re all gone the official added. The decommissioned nuclear power station has been under Russian control since late-February a move that has been subject to widespread international condemnation. There have also been concerns over the welfare of workers at the Chernobyl site. Russia says it will curb Kyiv assault as peace talks progress Putin demands Mariupol surrender to end shelling The UN\s Human Rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet meanwhile said Russia\s allegedly indiscriminate attacks on populated areas of Ukraine may amount to war crimes. Addressing the Human Rights Council in Geneva Switzerland on Tuesday she said there were credible allegations that Russia had used cluster munitions in populated areas on multiple occasions. Such weapons are widely banned by an international treaty but neither Russia nor Ukraine are signed up to it. Her office has also verified 77 incidents in which medical facilities had been damaged - including 50 hospitals. Russian attacks continue To date 350 civilians have been killed in the city with 25 to 40 casualties arriving at the hospitals every day Chernihivs mayor told the BBCs Ukrainian Service. Vladyslav Atroshenko said he never thought that as mayor he would ever have to look for extra fridges to store the bodies of the dead because the morgues are full. He never thought he would have to look for additional teams of carpenters to make coffins and for alternative places to bury the dead because the cemetery is too dangerous to travel to. Local officials said Russian shelling continued to hit civilian infrastructure in the city. The entire night was pretty tense regional governor Viacheslav Chaus told the BBC. They attacked Nizhyn and Chernihiv. Mostly Chernihiv. Again part of the civilian infrastructure was destroyed. Chernihiv still has no electricity water supply and heat. It won\t be easy to restore this infrastructure. None of the military buildings were targeted last night. They kept attacking only civilian infrastructure the governor said. The BBC has not been able to confirm this independently but residents of Chernihiv also said the fighting was continuing. This night was rough one resident told the BBC. We heard there was fighting all night in the suburbs away from the city centre. We heard artillery. But there was no aviation tonight. Another resident said shelling was continuing on Wednesday although not as intensely as overnight. Air raid sirens also sounded in Kyiv just a few hours after the announcement that troops would be reduced around the city. Kyivs deputy mayor Mykola Povoroznyk said the capital itself had not been shelled overnight however gunfire had been heard from battles around the city. US and Ukrainian officials say Russia is continuing to reposition forces away from Kyiv probably as part of an effort to refocus on eastern regions. Ukrainian forces have also made advances in recent days retaking areas from Russian forces. In Irpin near Kyiv the mayor said Ukrainian forces had retaken control of the town on Monday and around 200 to 300 civilians had died in the town before it was retaken. Developments on the ground come as Russian and Ukrainian negotiators made no breakthroughs in Tuesday\s peace talks the Kremlin said. War in Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine SURVIVAL: They wont tell me how many bullets were in me SHOOTING: Does video show Ukrainian war crime? READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Delegations from Moscow and Kyiv held three hours of discussions in Istanbul on Tuesday aimed at bringing to a close more than a month of fighting in Ukraine. Ukraine said it had proposed to become a neutral state in exchange for security guarantees. A key aim of Russias invasion was to stop Ukraine joining the Nato alliance and Russian officials said the talks had moved to a practical stage. Russia\s pledge to cut back military activity was met with scepticism. Ukrainians are not naïve people President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an overnight video address. Mr Zelensky said that initial signs from the peace talks were positive but added that they did not drown out the explosions of Russian shells. Other countries also reacted with caution. US President Joe Biden said: I don\t read anything into it until I see what their actions are. Leaders from UK France Germany and Italy also urged the West not to drop its guard against Russia. In other developments: Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that shelling of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol will only end when Ukrainian troops surrender Germany has declared an early warning over possible gas supply disruption amid a payments stand-off with Russia More than four million people have now fled Ukraine to escape Russias invasion according to the latest United Nations figures.

Media in Russia: How do Russians get news about the war in Ukraine?,"As censorship of the Russian media increases, what information do Russians have access to?",Media in Russia: How do Russians get news about the war in Ukraine? By Vitaliy Shevchenko BBC Monitoring Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS The situation in Russias media is unprecedented. Restrictions on reporting are increasingly severe and access to almost all independent outlets is blocked or limited - or they censor themselves. Despite this it is still possible to obtain uncensored information in Russia. For most Russians television remains the main source of the news. It is firmly controlled by the Kremlin and pumps out relentless war propaganda. Ukrainians are said to shell their own cities and Russian troops are presented as liberators. The fact that the majority of Russians tune in to TV news means they are inclined to at least hear the Kremlins message - and possibly believe it. There is more variety of opinion in the press but it still largely sticks to the Kremlin line. A stalwart of independent reporting for almost 29 years the Novaya Gazeta newspaper suspended operations on 28 March after receiving warnings from Russias media watchdog Roskomnadzor. IMAGE SOURCE NOVAYA GAZETA Image caption The day after the war began Novaya Gazetas front page exclaimed Russia. Bombs. Ukraine Online most independent news websites are blocked or restricted and so are Facebook Instagram and Twitter. But crucially these blocks are relatively easy to bypass. By now anyone in Russia who is reasonably savvy with computers and smartphones will be familiar with tools such as virtual private networks (VPNs) which help to circumvent the restrictions. They are not yet outlawed in Russia and they are what millions of Russians are using to access uncensored information. War in Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine SURVIVAL: They wont tell me how many bullets were in me SHOOTING: Does video show Ukrainian war crime? READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Reporting on the war is another matter. In early March Russia passed a law under which publishing false information about what the Russian army is doing is punishable by up to 15 years in jail. In practice this means punishment for reporting anything that challenges the Kremlin\s narratives on its campaign in Ukraine. The media are even banned from calling it a war: it is meant to be called a special military operation. As a result some of the few remaining independent media in Russia have started to censor themselves. For example Novaya Gazeta blurred out the anti-war poster held up by a protester who interrupted a live news bulletin on Russian state TV. В эфире программы «Время» за спиной ведущей Екатерины Андреевой появилась девушка с плакатом содержание которого нам запрещают передать Роскомнадзор и Уголовный кодекс.  По неподтвержденной информации это редактор Марина Овсянникова.

Among the most prominent outlets are the Meduza and Mediazona websites - both have been blocked in Russia and both are labelled as foreign agents by the Russian government. You will not silence us Meduza said in a defiant statement. We need independent media to stop the war and then try and improve life in Russia at least to a degree. Both websites operate from abroad due to restrictions at home. Media caption WATCH: Marina Ovsyannikova says none of her interrogators thought her TV protest was her idea]
"Homes for Ukraine: 2,700 visas issued, government reveals","Application forms take too long to fill in, the government admits, and vows to speed up the process.",Homes for Ukraine: 2700 visas issued government reveals By Lauren Turner BBC News Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE ANADOLU AGENCY There have been 2700 visas issued for refugees coming to the UK as part of Homes for Ukraine - less than 10% of the 28300 applications made in the schemes first 15 days. Lord Harrington refugees minister admitted the forms took too long to fill in and said the government was trying to speed up the process. There has been criticism of the scheme since it was launched. Charities said the process is just too difficult for those fleeing Ukraine. The quickest way to help people would be for the UK to stop requiring visas for those fleeing Ukraine - and would bring it in line with many other countries which have done so since the crisis began said the British Red Cross. The charity said it has had representatives at major airports and arrival hubs since 19 March - but so far only 65 people arriving from Ukraine had been helped. Sonya Sceats chief executive of the Freedom from Torture charity said: In a month where people across the country signed up to welcome more refugees than the government has in 10 years these woeful numbers prove why visa-based schemes are an unsuitable gateway for refugees fleeing Ukraine to reach safety here in the UK. Homeless refugees in UK On top of the 2700 Homes for Ukraine visas a further 22800 visas from 31200 applications have been issued under the Ukraine Family Scheme the Home Office said. These are for those with close relatives living in the UK. But even those with visas are not always being housed. Some refugees have been reporting themselves to councils as being homeless the Local Government Association said. Its chair James Jamieson said it was a big issue. So far 57 councils have said people had presented as homeless - 44 who were part of the family scheme and 56 from Homes from Ukraine. Another 64 had entered through other routes possibly travelling to Ireland and then entering the UK from there he added. How can I offer a UK home to Ukrainian refugees? Sad slow and frustrating Homes for Ukraine launched on 14 March. Its aim is to allow individuals charities community groups and other organisations to sponsor named refugees housing them in their homes or buildings. Those who do not personally know someone fleeing Ukraine have been advised to contact groups who are starting to make connections between individuals to match them to a refugee. The UK requires the refugees to have a visa before they enter unlike other European countries which have waived the checks to speed things up. Those who are granted a visa under the scheme will be eligible to work and can access state benefits and public services for three years. Refugees with a valid Ukrainian international passport can apply online but those without one have to go to a visa application centre - Lord Harrington said approximately 10% of applications so far are having to go to the centres. Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended the government\s overwhelmingly generous record on refugees saying 1000 visas were being processed a day and telling MPs: There is no upper limit to the number that we can take. It came after Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said paperwork is being put ahead of people with one elderly couple on the Polish border with Ukraine being told it was just too complicated to come to the UK. War in Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine SURVIVAL: They wont tell me how many bullets were in me SHOOTING: Does video show Ukrainian war crime? READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Lord Harrington said he had tried to fill the application form in himself and it had taken nearly an hour - he said while this was from the comfort of his own home on a tablet people were completing it on mobile phones while they were displaced. He told the Levelling Up Housing and Communities Committee progress was already being seen due to Home Office efforts to streamline the visa process and the government was looking at every single step of the process to speed it up. But he added: We need to do more and will be making further improvements to bring people to the UK as quickly as possible. Lord Harrington said in some parts of the form there were four or five separate questions on as many pages suggesting this could be condensed to one page. He added: The response of the British public has been incredible opening their hearts and homes to the people of Ukraine and we must do everything we can to make the most of this extraordinary generosity. The minister said the run rate for applications for both schemes together was anticipated to soon be 15000 a week - within the next three weeks - and that he anticipated the backlog would be cleared quite quickly. IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption Refugees can also enter the UK if they have close relatives in the country like this family of 10 who are now living near Cambridge Labour is calling for the process to be expedited with Yvette Cooper shadow home secretary and shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy writing to their government counterparts. They said a shameful scale of bureaucracy was preventing desperately vulnerable people from reaching sanctuary in the UK calling for clarity on the length of time taken for visas to be issued and how long security checks are taking. The UN refugee agency said more than four million refugees have now fled Ukraine since Russia launched its war in the biggest refugee crisis since World War Two.

Ukraine family in Alton 'supported with kindness',Pharmacist Biola Ameri and her children fled Kyiv and currently reside in Alton.,Ukraine family in Alton supported with kindness Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption Biola Ameri and her daughters have found a temporary home in Hampshire A woman who came to the UK with her two daughters to escape the conflict in Ukraine has spoken of the kindness they have received since arriving. Pharmacist Biola Ameri 42 Gabriella eight and Daniella six fled Kyiv and currently reside in Alton Hampshire. Her husband Igor is currently in Vinnytsia helping women and children in Ukraine reach the border with Moldova. Ms Ameri said: I didn\t want to leave Ukraine. I love Ukraine. She came to the UK not via the Homes for Ukraine scheme but on a tourist visa that she had previously applied for to visit Scotland but hopes to get permission to stay when it runs out. They are being hosted by the family of Lisa Hillan and the children are said to have received a warm welcome at a local school. IMAGE SOURCE EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCY Image caption The family fled Kyiv when the war broke out Ms Ameri said: I was really overwhelmed with my emotions when I first came to England and when I first met people who don\t know us but who can support us with all this kindness for our family. She said she cried at border control and that someone there was very worried about us and brought an apple and juice for the children. I saw that everybody wants to help us and I really feel not as a guest but as a part of a family. Ms Hallan who is a member of Alton Town Council\s resilience fund panel said what the family had endured was heartrending. It\s difficult to fathom that this is not a historical documentary that this is happening to people like us in another county. It\s mindboggling and horrific she said. There is a desperate need to do something practical to help in some small way. My husband and I feel like we can\t just sit here and do nothing. Ukraine-Alton Mutual Aid was set up in Alton to enable residents to offer rooms transport clothes and English lessons. But Ms Ameri said: My daughter... made a wish for the tooth-fairy. She said \I don\t want any presents or money - I just want the tooth-fairy to bring our daddy here.\]

What is a war crime and could Putin be prosecuted over Ukraine?,If Russia has carried out war crimes in Ukraine how could Putin or his army generals be prosecuted?,What is a war crime and could Putin be prosecuted over Ukraine? By Dominic Casciani Legal correspondent BBC News Published 6 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS A former judge at the International Criminal Court has been asked by the UK to help Ukraine investigate potential war crimes by Russia. Sir Howard Morrisons appointment comes as Russia stands accused of violating international law in its invasion of Ukraine. What is a war crime? It may not seem like it but even war has rules as the International Committee of the Red Cross puts it. These are contained in treaties called the Geneva Conventions and a string of other international laws and agreements. Civilians cannot be deliberately attacked - nor can the infrastructure that is vital to their survival. UK war crimes lawyer appointed to help Ukraine Some weapons are banned because of the indiscriminate or appalling suffering they cause - such as anti-personnel landmines and chemical or biological weapons. The sick and wounded must be cared for - including injured soldiers who have rights as prisoners of war. Other laws prohibit torture and genocide - the deliberate attempt to destroy a specific group of people. Serious offences during war such as murder rape or mass persecution of a group are known as crimes against humanity. What allegations of war crimes have there been in Ukraine? Last week US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia had destroyed apartment buildings schools hospitals critical infrastructure civilian vehicles shopping centres and ambulances - actions that the US said amounted to war crimes. The UK has said barbaric and indiscriminate tactics have been used by Russia. In the wake of an attack on a theatre sheltering civilians in the besieged port city of Mariupol Ukrainian officials accused Russia of carrying out a war crime. At the time of the strike - which Russia denies carrying out - the word children was written in giant letters on the ground outside the building. Ukraine previously called Russias air strike on Mariupols hospital a war crime. Three people were killed and 17 staff and patients were injured. Russian troops are also accused of targeting fleeing civilians. Theres mounting evidence that cluster bombs - munitions that separate into lots of bomblets - have hit civilian areas of Kharkiv. IMAGE SOURCE PRIVATE/HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH Image caption Apparent evidence of a cluster bomb sub-munition in Kharkiv passed to Human Rights Watch The UK says Russia has used thermobaric explosives which create a massive vacuum by sucking up oxygen. These are not banned but their deliberate use near civilians would almost certainly break the rules of war. Many experts argue the invasion itself is a crime under the concept of aggressive warfare. Putin has carried out war crimes - Boris Johnson How are suspected war criminals pursued? Each country has a duty to investigate suspected war crimes. Some nations do so more than others. In the UK senior police officers have offered to help gather evidence of potential crimes in Ukraine. How can suspected war criminals be prosecuted? There have been a series of one-off courts since World War Two - including the tribunal investigating war crimes during the break-up of Yugoslavia. A body was also set up to prosecute those responsible for the 1994 Rwanda genocide. IMAGE SOURCE AFP Image caption Théoneste Bagosora died while serving a 35-year sentence for his role in the 1994 Rwandan genocide Today the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) have roles upholding the rules of war. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) rules on disputes between states but cannot prosecute individuals. Ukraine has begun a case against Russia. If the ICJ ruled against Russia the UN Security Council (UNSC) would be responsible for enforcing that. But Russia - one of councils five permanent members - could veto any proposal to sanction it. The International Criminal Court (ICC) The ICC investigates and prosecutes individual war criminals who are not before the courts of individual states. Its the permanent modern successor to Nuremberg which prosecuted key Nazi leaders in 1945. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Nazis prosecuted at the Nuremberg trials included Hermann Goring Rudolf Hess and Joachim von Ribbentrop Nuremberg cemented the principle that nations could set up a special court to uphold international law. Can the ICC prosecute offences in Ukraine? The ICCs chief prosecutor British lawyer Karim Khan QC says there is a reasonable basis to believe war crimes have been carried out in Ukraine. Investigators will look at past and present allegations - going back as far as 2013 before Russias annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. If theres evidence the prosecutor will ask ICC judges to issue arrest warrants to bring individuals to trial in The Hague. But there are practical limitations to its power. The court doesnt have its own police force so relies on individual states to arrest suspects. Like the US Russia is not a member of the court - it pulled out in 2016. President Putin wont extradite any suspects. If a suspect went to another country they could be arrested - but thats a very big if. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Could President Putin or other leaders be prosecuted? Its far easier to pin a war crime on a soldier who commits it than the leader who ordered it. But the ICC can also prosecute the offence of waging aggressive war. This is the crime of an unjustified invasion or conflict beyond justifiable military action in self-defence. It originated at Nuremberg after the judge sent by Moscow convinced the Allies that Nazi leaders should face justice for crimes against peace. However Professor Philippe Sands QC an expert on international law at University College London says the ICC couldnt prosecute Russias leaders for this because the country isnt a signatory to the court. In theory the UN Security Council could ask the ICC to investigate this offence. But again Russia could veto this. So is there any other way to prosecute individuals? The effectiveness of the ICC - and the way international law plays out in practice - depend not just on treaties but politics and diplomacy. And Prof Sands and many other experts argue that like Nuremberg the solution lies once more in diplomacy and international agreement. Hes calling for world leaders to set up a one-off tribunal to prosecute the crime of aggression in Ukraine.

Ukraine war: Russia says it will curb Kyiv assault as peace talks progress,"Moscow says it will ""drastically reduce"" operations around the capital, Kyiv, as well as Chernihiv.",Ukraine war: Russia says it will curb Kyiv assault as peace talks progress Published 4 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption Moscow also pledged to curtail the assault on Chernihiv which has been encircled by Russian forces Russia has announced it will drastically reduce military combat operations in two key areas of Ukraine to boost mutual trust in peace talks. The decision to scale back operations around the capital Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv is the first sign of tangible progress from talks. But it is unclear how extensive any reduction in military activity might be and Ukraine remains sceptical. The US and UK also said the pledge should be treated with caution. On Tuesday Russia\s deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin said the country would radically by several times reduce the military activity around Kyiv and Chernihiv. He added that there had been progress on the neutrality and non-nuclear status of Ukraine which are two key concerns for Moscow. But Russia\s pledge to scale back its forces was met with scepticism. Ukrainians are not naive people President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an overnight video address. We can say that the signals... are positive but those signals do not drown out the explosions or Russian shells he added. We\ve only seen a small number begin to move away from Kyiv Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said adding that people should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine. The UK Defence Ministry also warned that Russia will likely seek to divert combat power from the north to their offensive in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east. Russia has already refocused its campaign on Ukraines eastern regions. It has suffered a series of setbacks to the north of the capital Kyiv and is also seeking to capture a land corridor which stretches along the south coast to the Russian border. The key word - scepticism The discussions lasted about three hours. Very little was leaked and nearly all media were kept away in a packed area on a pavement. The key points became clear as members of the Ukrainian delegation came out onto the street an hour before the expected finish. The negotiators said they had proposed to Russia that Ukraine adopt a neutral status in exchange for security guarantees - an international mechanism where guarantor countries would act to protect Ukraine in future. In return Kyiv would not join Nato a key Russian demand. This was not a new pledge but it was spelt out in the clearest detail yet. Many are sceptical about what Russias announcement about reducing military operations actually means; whether its a pledge to pull back or merely an acceptance it has already failed in those areas and will instead turn its full force further east. Western countries therefore are saying they will judge Russia by its actions and not its words. Read more from Tom here. During the ceasefire talks on Tuesday Ukraine proposed to become a neutral state in exchange for security guarantees. A key aim of Russias invasion was to stop Ukraine joining the Nato alliance and Russian officials said the talks had moved to a practical stage. Ukrainian negotiator Oleksandr Chaly told reporters that its offer of neutrality - which means it would not ally itself militarily with others - was a chance to restore the territorial integrity and security of Ukraine through diplomatic and political means. Russian forces have encircled Chernihiv where officials say up to 400 people have been killed and some 130000 residents are without heating electricity or water supplies. Russia\s chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said talks had been meaningful and Ukraine\s proposals on neutrality would be put to President Vladimir Putin. However he made clear that before a presidential summit could happen a treaty would have to be drafted and approved by negotiators and then signed by foreign ministers. This is not a ceasefire but this is our aspiration gradually to reach a de-escalation of the conflict at least on these fronts Mr Medinsky told Russian state news agency Tass.

Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said this framework would enable a ceasefire to be agreed without Crimea and the eastern regions being settled. The proposals would also enable Ukraine to join the European Union while barring it from becoming part of Natos defensive military alliance.]

The Times says the idea would be a way for the Kremlin to cut its losses but the i reports that Ukraine has warned it would retaliate with guerrilla warfare. The Telegraph also leads with the war but concentrates on what it calls the international backlash to a speech by President Joe Biden in which he appeared to suggest that President Putin could not remain in power. The paper says the comment put his relations with Western allies under strain while fuelling the Kremlins claim that Russia is faced with an existential threat from the West. The Financial Times fears that the unity of the US the EU and Nato could begin to fray. The Express says there could be a new council tax cut on the way for millions of people struggling with the rising cost of living. The paper says the chancellor has been forced to look at additional ways to help households following criticism over the lack of measures in his Spring Statement last week. A number of papers concentrate on the fallout from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridges tour of Belize Jamaica and the Bahamas which was overshadowed by questions about the future role of the Royal Family in the Caribbean.

Ukraine war: What next for the African students who fled?,The thousands who left are now faced with a decision about where to continue their studies.,Ukraine war: What next for the African students who fled? By Soraya Ali BBC News Published 4 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE DESMOND MUOKWUDO Image caption Desmond Chinaza Muokwudo was a welder in Nigeria before studying in Ukraine Desmond Chinaza Muokwudo a 30-year-old Nigerian student who has recently fled Ukraine spent 11 years saving up for an education in Europe. Once a pipeline welder from Anambra state he dreamt of studying international relations - but he struggled with unemployment amid a recession in 2016. It was only after his parents decided to sell their small plot of land that he managed to raise enough funds to pursue his dream. He finally enrolled last year at university and had only spent three months in Ukraine when Russia launched its full-scale invasion. My parents have nothing left they can\t support me he explained over the phone from his temporary accommodation in Berlin Germany sounding defeated. My government just tells me to come back home but there\s nothing waiting for me in Nigeria. Mr Muokwudo is one of the estimated 16000 African students who were living in Ukraine and are now scrambling to continue their studies. Many had a traumatic time fleeing amid reports of racial abuse at the border. Media caption Nigerian student who fled Ukraine: They are only helping Ukrainians. Hundreds have returned home on repatriation flights though exact numbers are unclear but thousands like Mr Muokwudo are likely to still be in Europe. I have sacrificed too much to get here. I have to stay in Europe and I have to get an education Mr Muokwudo said. Universities across the world have extended a helping hand to students fleeing Ukraine in the form of guaranteed places discounted tuition fees and relaxed visa requirements. African officials have also increased diplomatic efforts to get assurances for their students with foreign ministers meeting with their European counterparts to broker deals. Up to 250 university places are being offered in Hungary to stranded medical students according to Ghanaian officials - and Ghanas government reportedly has a deal with Grenada for 200 to be enrolled at the St Georges University of Medicine. Semmelweis University in Hungary which is allowing medical students to continue their studies for free until the war is over says it has received more than 2000 applications in just a few weeks mainly from Africans. However many students say that these offers are granted on a case-by-case basis and wrapped up in red tape. They largely depend on what degree students are undertaking how many years they have already completed and how much they can still afford to pay. Mr Muokwudo complained that some universities would not take non-Ukrainians. \We only take Ukrainian citizens\ that\s what I\ve been told he said referring to a policy at Tallinn University in Estonia. The university confirmed that only Ukrainians could apply outside the usual admission process but said that international students were still welcome to apply the regular way. Online seminars The war has left many of these students with difficult choices - and left some with the prospect of not qualifying. Nigeria has welcomed back more than 1000 people mainly students from Ukraine according to a government tally. Among them was 22-year-old medical student Fehintola Moses Damilola who was trapped in the besieged city of Sumy for weeks. I\m just happy to be safe and with my parents he said speaking to the BBC from his home in Oyo state. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Some universities in Ukraine - this is one in Kharkiv - are trying to continue classes online despite the war It is his first visit home in more than five years - and he is just one semester away from becoming a qualified doctor. This is still likely to happen as he is lucky to be able to rely on online classes which despite the ongoing conflict some Ukrainian universities are offering using the digital infrastructure developed during pandemic lockdowns. In Nigerias Kaduna state Firdausi Mohammed Usman has also begun online classes. The 22-year-old medical student is in her fifth year at the National Medical University in Kharkiv an eastern Ukrainian city that has faced nightly shelling. She said that the professors were holding online practical seminars and some appeared on the screen. Her teachers are being understandably tight-lipped about their exact location for safety reasons. Some have fled the country but others are still in Ukraine and leaving basement bomb shelters to host classes upstairs. They don\t want us to all drop out or transfer somewhere else - otherwise the university might be forced to close down forever. We don\t have access to our transcripts academic records] so this is the best option for now. I dont want to go backwards Mr Damilola who was president of the Nigerian Students Union in Sumy also stressed the importance of online classes for medical students in their final year like him. IMAGE SOURCE FEHINTOLA MOSES DAMILOLA Image caption Fehintola Moses Damilola seen here on right with fellow students had been in Ukraine since he was 17 It might be hard with this internet but I only have one semester left and I can\t afford to start at a new university he said struggling to be heard as the WhatsApp line kept breaking up. He also felt that finishing his degree in Nigeria would mean going backwards academically. Marcel Chidera from Nigerias Enugu state is continuing his education in Poland having turned down a repatriation flight organised by his government. He is not the only one. Angola arranged a flight for its citizens to return home from Warsaw. It expected to take home 277 people but only 30 boarded. Going back home without a degree was not an option Mr Chidera said from his temporary accommodation in the Polish capital. The 25-year-old counted himself lucky as he had only completed a Ukrainian language course so was free to start a new degree. Most courses in Poland are offered in English and open to international students though the costs and admission requirements are often tougher than in Ukraine. He has found a discounted business management degree at a Polish university - and considered himself better off than others in his family in Nigeria where university lecturers have been on a nationwide strike since 14 February. My siblings are studying in Nigeria right now. They\re not even in classes because of the strikes he said. Opportunity for Africa Higher education across Africa has long suffered from insufficient funding a shortage of qualified staff and low investment in research and development according to local NGOs and UN agencies. Only 60 African universities made the top 1500 listed globally according to World University Rankings. South Africa home to the continents top universities has stepped up efforts to help returning students. Dr Mamphela Ramphele the former vice-chancellor of the University of Cape Town the highest-ranking school in Africa called it an opportunity to rethink the way we address support to young people. That sentiment has appealed to students like Zoe Inutu in Zambia who are searching for options at home. She was two years into her public relations degree in Zaporizhzhia south-east Ukraine when the war began. My transcripts are stuck in Ukraine so I will probably have to start a new degree she said. I will go anywhere that will take me including Africa as long as I am safe.

Russia-Ukraine war: Abramovich spotted in Istanbul peace talks,"The Russian billionaire was seen as the talks began, following reports that he suffered poisoning symptoms.",Russia-Ukraine war: Abramovich spotted in Istanbul peace talks Published 4 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE TURKISH TV Image caption Roman Abramovich is seen sitting at a table alongside Ibrahim Kalin - a spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has appeared at peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey. He was seen talking to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who is mediating in the talks in Istanbul. Reports surfaced hours earlier that Mr Abramovich and two Ukrainian negotiators had shown poisoning symptoms after talks in early March. Mr Abramovich is known to have spent weeks in a mediation role flying between Moscow and Kyiv. The Chelsea football club owner was said to have suffered sore eyes and peeling skin but had now recovered reports say. A Wall Street Journal report suggested he and the Ukrainian negotiators had been targeted by Russian hardliners in Kyiv on 3 March but a Ukrainian presidential official later said the two Ukrainians were fine and one had said the story was false. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov poured scorn on the report on Tuesday as untrue and part of an information war. Ukraines Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba however told national TV hours before the talks that he had advised his colleagues attending negotiations with Russia not to eat or drink anything. Russian state news agency Ria Novosti released a picture showing Mr Abramovich talking to the Turkish president and Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu at the meeting.

They were not at the main table of the Russian and Ukrainian delegations. The exact nature of Mr Abramovichs role in the talks is unclear although Ukrainian media said he was there as a neutral party. The Kremlin spokesman stressed he was not an official member of the Russian delegation in Istanbul but had been involved in enabling contacts between the two delegations. Ukraine\s UK ambassador Vadym Prystaiko was scathing about his presence in Istanbul: I have no idea what Mr Abramovich is claiming or doing. He is not a part of the negotiation team he told the BBC. I don\t know if he\s buying his way out somehow or if he\s really useful that\s very difficult to tell.

A number of enemies of the Kremlin have suffered mysterious poisonings in recent years including Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny who was attacked with a nerve agent in Siberia and activist activist Vladimir Kara-Murza who survived two incidents.

How the sex trade preys on Ukraine's refugees,Trafficking rings are notoriously active in and around Ukraine - and the fog of war is perfect cover.,How the sex trade preys on Ukraines refugees Katya Adler Europe editor @BBCkatyaadler on Twitter Published 7 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption Refugees are forced to put their trust in strangers Five weeks into Russias brutal invasion of Ukraine imagine for a moment what its like to live there now. Bombs bloodshed trauma. No school for your children no healthcare for your parents no safe roof over your head in many parts of the country. Would you try to run? Ten million Ukrainians have according to the United Nations. Most seek refuge in other areas of Ukraine believed to be safer. But more than three and a half million people have fled over the border. They are mainly women and children as men under the age of 60 are obliged by the Ukrainian government to stay put and fight. Displaced and disoriented often with no idea where to go next refugees are forced to put their trust in strangers. The chaos of war is now behind them but the truth is theyre not entirely safe outside Ukraine either. For predators and human traffickers the war in Ukraine is not a tragedy UN Secretary General António Guterres warned on Twitter. It\s an opportunity - and women and children are the targets. Trafficking rings are notoriously active in Ukraine and neighbouring countries in peace time. The fog of war is perfect cover to increase business. Karolina Wierzbińska a coordinator at Homo Faber a human rights organisation based in Lublin told me children were a huge concern. Many youngsters were travelling out of Ukraine unaccompanied she said. Patchy registration processes in Poland and other border regions - especially at the start of the war - meant children disappeared their current whereabouts unknown. My colleagues and I headed down to the Polish-Ukrainian border to see for ourselves. At a train station well known for refugee arrivals we found a hive of activity. Dazed-looking women and crying children were all around. Image caption Women and their children have been arriving at the border area Many were being comforted and offered hot food from steaming industrial-sized cooking pots by an army of volunteers wearing high-vis gilets. So far so well organised right? Not quite. We met Margherita Husmanov a Ukrainian refugee from Kyiv in her early 20s. She arrived at the border two weeks ago but decided to stay on to help stop fellow refugees falling into the wrong hands. I asked her if she felt vulnerable. Yes she told me. That\s especially why I worry about their safety. The women and children come here from a terrible war. They don\t speak Polish or English. They don\t know what\s going on and they believe what anyone tells them. Anyone can turn up at this station. The first day I volunteered we saw three men from Italy. They were looking for beautiful women to sell into the sex trade. I called the police and it turned out I was right. It wasn\t paranoia. It\s horrible. Image caption Margherita Husmanov is a refugee turned volunteer Margherita says local officials are a bit more organised now. Police regularly patrol the station. The people (mainly men were told) with cardboard signs to tempting destinations so present in the first couple of weeks of refugee arrivals have largely disappeared. But as we find out from a number of sources other ill-intentioned individuals are now posing as high-vis-wearing volunteers. Elena Moskvitina spoke out on Facebook to raise awareness. Shes now safely in Denmark so we chatted at length via Skype. Her experience is chilling. She and her children crossed into neighbouring Romania from war-torn Ukraine. They were looking for a lift away from the border. What she described as fake volunteers at a refugee centre asked where she was staying. They turned up later in the day and aggressively told her Switzerland was the best place to go and that theyd give her a lift there with a van full of other women. Elena told me the men looked at her and her daughter sleazily. Her daughter was petrified. They asked her to show them her son who was in another room. They looked him up and down she said. They then insisted she travel with no-one else except them and they got angry when she asked to see their ID cards. To get the men away from her family Elena promised to meet them when the other women were in their van. But as soon as they left she told me she grabbed her children and ran. Image caption Elżbieta Jarmulska offers safe passage to Ukrainian refugees Elżbieta Jarmulska a feisty Polish entrepreneur is the founder of the Women Take The Wheel Initiative. Her aim she says is to provide Ukrainian refugees with a bubble of safety. Those women have been through so much already walking or driving their way through a war zone and then they are exposed to fear and exploitation here? I have no words for what that must be like she says. By now she has recruited more than 650 Polish amazing women as she describes them driving backwards and forwards as often as they can to the Polish-Ukrainian border in order to offer refugees safe passage. I accompany Elżbieta better known as Ela to a refugee centre where she makes a point of showing her ID card and proof of residence to officials before she asks if anyone wants a lift to Warsaw. Her car was full in moments. The passengers: refugee Nadia and her three children. Ela settled the family into her thoughtfully stocked car offering the small children water chocolate and motion-sickness tablets if they needed them. Image caption Nadia and her children are grateful for the lift Nadia meanwhile told me of her dangerous journey out of Ukraine from Kharkiv. Now in Poland she was so relieved she said to have a female driver. Shed heard of the risks of trafficking and exploitation on Ukrainian radio. But she came anyway. Her home was being shelled she said. The risks of war were more immediate. Ela has the refugees best interests at heart. But leaving the border safely doesnt mean the danger is over for them. Most we spoke to hoped to go home as soon as the violence ends. But over the next days weeks even months they need somewhere to sleep to eat to send their children to school as well as a job to properly support themselves. Those needs make refugees vulnerable. EU leaders have unanimously approved a measure to open up the job market schools and access to health care for Ukrainians but as human rights groups point out refugees need help to get registered and be informed of their rights. One of the volunteers I met at the Polish-Ukrainian border told me that when youre down and out friendless and in need of money you can all too easily end up doing things you would have never imagined. This woman was lured into prostitution when she was younger. And that she says is a large part of the reason shes helping Ukrainian refugees now. I want to protect them. To warn them she told me. She asked me not to reveal her name. She\s since turned her life around and doesn\t want her children to know about her past. Image caption Refugees are all too vulnerable to exploitation Five weeks into Russias onslaught in Ukraine processes across Europe screening those claiming to help Ukrainians are still far from foolproof. Organised crime (including sex and organ trafficking and frequently slave labour) is not the only menace. Refugees are exploited by individuals too. People in Poland Germany the UK and elsewhere have opened up their homes to refugees most with the best of intentions. But sadly not all. We found a post on social media from a Ukrainian woman who fled to Düsseldorf in Germany. The man who offered her a room confiscated her ID papers and demanded she clean his house for free. He then started to make sexual advances as well. She refused - and he kicked her out on the street. Irena Dawid-Olczyk chief executive of the Warsaw branch of anti-trafficking NGO La Strada told me the story was all too familiar. That kind of thing happens war or no war she told me. But an avalanche of conflict-scarred women and children bursting out of Ukraine means that exploitation and abuse cases escalate. She cites teenage refugees as a particular concern. We all know teenagers don\t we? They\re insecure. They want acceptance and recognition she says. And if they are refugees who are far from home and friends they\re even easier to exploit. Girls might love attention lavished on them by older men. Or they\ll be introduced to a cool girl their own age who has great clothes and invites them to parties. That\s how it starts. Don\t forget it\s not only men who are pimps traffickers and abusers. Image caption Refugees are given leaflets offering help The push factors for Ukrainian women to accept seemingly generous online offers to escape their difficulties also increase manyfold in war time. Without revealing identities Irena reels off case after case that La Strada Poland is working on - Ukrainian girls offered plane tickets to Mexico Turkey the UAE without ever having met the men inviting them. My colleagues are trying to persuade a 19-year-old girl not to join her friend at a man\s house she says. She knows her friend has been beaten. But the man calls her on her mobile says sweet things and offers her presents. If they insist on going we beg the girls to at least register with the local authorities. If they don\t they have our phone number. I hope they can call us if they need us. Governments across Europe have pledged solidarity with Ukraine. Human rights groups want them to take better care of those running for their lives. They need protection.]

Harry Richardson a teacher from Leek in Staffordshire moved to the country three years ago after marrying his wife Alina a Ukrainian national. After sheltering in a basement they escaped the fighting to Moldova on 3 March returning home at the weekend. Mr Richardson said he had been marked by the cruelty he had seen but was touched by the community response. I never thought I would be in a war he said. That was the furthest from my imagination. What my wife and I have seen are things we never wanted to see... You see that cruelty but at the other end of the scale you also see how that can also bring out the kindness of people the compassion the humanity. Image caption Mr Richardson said he will continue to campaign for more support for victims of the war Mr Richardson and his family took refuge in a university basement in Uman sometimes for up to nine hours at a time. When I went down those stairs into the bunker for the first time I stood there and I looked and I thought: I\m on a film set because that\s exactly what it was like. For the first couple of days of the war it didn\t seem real that we were sitting in a bunker with 80-90 other people he said.

"Ukraine war is our war, say Brit ex-squaddies heading to Lviv",Three ex-British Army soldiers now in Ukraine on what has led them to fight for another country.,Ukraine war is our war say Brit ex-squaddies heading to Lviv By Jonah Fisher BBC News Lviv Ukraine Published 7 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption Inside Ukraine but now what? From left: Kieran Perkins Elliot Davies and CJ Darton The road to war for CJ Elliott and Kieran ran through Facebook a cheap flight to Poland and a cold night sleeping outside a railway station. We meet the former British soldiers in Ukraine just outside a school a couple of kilometres from the border with Poland. They are waiting for a minibus to transport them along with other recruits to Lviv. I just can\t sit at home and watch what\s going on and carry on as usual says CJ Darton who served for seven years with the Royal Anglian Regiment. When Russia invaded Ukraine in February he almost immediately began making plans to volunteer. If you\re not fighting in someone else\s street does it end up in yours? Do my kids become a target? Do my mates\ kids? Between them the three men have 19 years of experience in the British military and all did tours in Afghanistan. After exchanging messages online they met for the first time at Stansted airport as they waited to catch a £20 Ryanair flight to the Polish city of Krakow. We were stopped by police on the way out recounts Kieran Perkins 35 who works as a plumber near Brighton. They said \fair play to you\. As far as I\m aware we\re not doing anything wrong. Plans in secret Hundreds of former British soldiers who have completed their time in the armed services have said they want to go to Ukraine to fight or help with medical or humanitarian efforts. Many told the BBC earlier this month that they are getting mixed messages from the government about whether they should go. The legal position at home is vague. In February Foreign Secretary Liz Truss encouraged people to go only for Downing Street to advise people with no combat experience not to. The Ministry of Defence meanwhile says it may be against the law and could lead to prosecution. That first night in Poland the men slept out outside Przemyśl railway station before walking across into Ukraine the following morning. Elliott Davies a construction worker from Colchester Essex and CJ had both told their families where they were going. Kieran a father of four had not. The former armoured vehicle driver with the Princess of Wales Royal Regiment didnt tell the childrens mothers he says trying to suppress a smile. I didn\t even tell my mum. I just thought because I\m only away for a short period of time... I didn\t want to worry anyone. BBC Where will it stop? Who else could suffer if we dont do something? Elliot Former Grenadier Guardsman Kieran is not planning on a long war. He only wants to stay in Ukraine for two or three weeks before returning home explaining that he has childcare responsibilities and a birthday coming up. I\m not expecting to get to the front line in that time. But if everyone chips in to help then it takes the weight off the people that are really working hard right at the front line. By contrast Elliott says hes in Ukraine for as long as it takes. I\ll help out wherever I can in the field he says. Anywhere from back to front. Bearded with long curly hair the 28-year-old served for seven years with the Grenadier Guards and says he is ready if necessary to die in Ukraine. Where will it stop? Who else could suffer if we don\t do something? Locals gratitude Also waiting by the side of the road is an American ex-marine Nate Vance. A consultant in the oil and gas industry he felt it was his duty to come and see what he could do. If somebody was bombing the United States and bombing civilian-occupied areas and my children were in those civilian-occupied areas I would want anyone and everyone that could help. And how would he respond to those who say this war is a long way from the United States? So was Germany in World War Two. If he Russian President Putin] gets away with it and he\s successful it just encourages more of that behaviour. Image caption Bussing it towards battle - Elliot CJ and Kieran prepare for another leg of their journey As they chat to us the men somehow manage to miss the minibus supposed to transport them and other prospective recruits to the city of Lviv. So they board a regular bus and end up chatting to Julia who has just dropped her daughter at the border to travel into the European Union as a refugee. Thank you very much that you have come here to help she tells them. Our Ukrainian soldiers are also very brave very brave. The men now have a choice to make. One option is to sign up with Ukraines International Legion. That could mean committing to stay for the duration of the war. In return theyd get paid the same as rank-and-file Ukrainian soldiers. A more flexible choice is to remain unattached and link up with other British former soldiers who are already fighting at the front line bypassing what might turn out to be painful Ukrainian bureaucracy. As they prepare to leave I ask whether it was the excitement of war that had brought them to Ukraine. Anyone who thinks we\re war junkies or war tourists needs to stick to watching the news CJ says. There is no excitement to war. There\s nothing nice about dead kids at the side of the road.

Ukraine calls for Nepal to ban Russian climbers from Himalayas,Nepal has issued permits to nine Russian climbers despite a Ukrainian call for them to be banned.,Ukraine calls for Nepal to ban Russian climbers from Himalayas By Navin Singh Khadka Environment correspondent BBC World Service Published 4 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Mountaineers pictured during their ascent to the summit of Mount Everest Nine Russians have been given permits to climb peaks in Nepal this spring despite calls from Ukrainian diplomats and mountaineers for them to be banned after President Putin sent troops into Ukraine. A diplomatic note from the Ukrainian embassy in Delhi to Nepals government says numerous international sports federations have barred Russian athletes. Taking into consideration the above the esteemed Nepalese side is kindly requested to ban Russian mountaineering teams until the end of the] Russian invasion into Ukraine the letter reads. But officials in Nepal say they are continuing to issue permits to anyone abiding by the governments rules and regulations There has been no change in our policy so far the director general of Nepal\s tourism department Taranath Adhikari told the BBC. We believe our mountains are global assets and any countries\ citizens willing to visit them for attainment of peace should be allowed to do so - as long as they do it within our legal provisions. The Ukrainian embassy in Delhi says it made its request to the Nepalese embassy in the Indian capital on 21 March but Nepalese embassy officials told the BBC they had received no communication on the issue. For the spring climbing season which usually lasts until the end of May one Russian climber has received a permit to climb Annapurna I (8091m) while eight others have been given permits for peaks below 6500m. We have carried on with our usual policy. Moreover the government has not said anything in this regard so we have not taken any new decision says Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA) president Santa Bir Lama. IMAGE SOURCE OLEG IVANCHENKO Image caption Russian and Ukrainian climbers have climbed Himalayan peaks together in the past Irina Galay who describes herself as the first Ukrainian woman to ascend Everest and K2 the world\s highest and second highest mountains wrote on Instagram that Russians should not have the privilege of climbing as long as war is continued. No peace no climb. Hopefully soon we will have peace and climb. Oleg Ivanchenko a Ukrainian mountain guide was planning to climb Mount Everest and Mount Lhotse this spring with two of his clients but had to cancel after the Russian invasion. I know some people say mountains are sacred and it is not a place for politics but we expect support from Russian mountaineers as well and they can protest - or at least not climb and stay in Russia he says. No Ukrainian climbers are now expected this spring. We had around 35 climbers from Ukraine coming in for different mountains including Everest but all of them have cancelled says Mingma Sherpa chairman of Seven Summit Treks a mountaineering and trekking operator in Nepal. We have seen cancellations from Russians as well as other European climbers because of the war. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Expedition operators in Nepal say they are neutral while dealing with mountaineers of all nationalities Nepals department of tourism has so far issued permits for 18 expedition teams to climb mountains above 6000m this spring season. Of the 135 climbers in these teams only one is from Russia. More permits may be issued before mountaineers usually begin their final ascent in May so the total number could change. However expedition operators say the war has caused a significant decline in business. Last year in the spring and autumn climbing seasons 49 Russians and 19 Ukrainians were registered on Nepalese mountains higher than 8000m according to the Himalayan Database which records data related to mountaineering in the Nepalese Himalayas. Out of them 14 Russian and six Ukrainian climbers were on Everest. A record number of more than 400 foreign climbers were given permits for Everest alone in 2021. But permits have been issued for only three Everest expedition of 16 climbers this spring season which is traditionally busier than the autumn. Officials with the Expedition Operators Association of Nepal say they are neutral while dealing with mountaineers. We are professional operators and we serve our clients irrespective of their nationalities says association president Dambar Parajuli.

Ukraine war: Dozens of Russian diplomats expelled by four EU nations,"More than 40 diplomats are told to leave by Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland and the Czech Republic.",Ukraine war: Dozens of Russian diplomats expelled by four EU nations Published 4 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmès told MPs that 21 Russian diplomats will be expelled In a co-ordinated move four EU countries are expelling more than 40 Russian diplomats suspected of spying. Ireland Belgium the Netherlands and the Czech Republic issued expulsion orders to a total of 43 embassy staffers on Tuesday afternoon. The move follows similar actions taken by other EU members including Poland in the past week. Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmès told MPs that the expulsions were related to our national security. Speaking to parliament Ms Wilmès said that 21 members of staff at the Russian embassy in Brussels and at the consulate in Antwerp had been asked to leave the country giving them two weeks to depart. She added that the move was made in conjunction with Belgium\s neighbour the Netherlands whose foreign ministry said it was expelling 17 Russian diplomats it considered to be secretly active as intelligence officers. Irelands Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Micheál Martin told MPs that his government had expelled four Russian diplomats after receiving security advice from its intelligence officials. Mr Martin said the officials had been asked to leave the state because their activities are not in accordance with the international standards of diplomatic behaviour. Russia\s embassy in Dublin said it rejected the groundless decision adding that it would deteriorate further Russian-Irish relations. Meanwhile a Czech official told the AFP news agency that the diplomat expelled from Prague was Russias deputy ambassador. Together with our Allies we are reducing the Russian intelligence presence in the EU the Czech foreign ministry tweeted. On Wednesday Poland expelled 45 accredited diplomats for engaging in suspected espionage in the country. Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski wrote on Twitter that Polish intelligence officials were dismantling the Russian special services network in our country. And earlier this month Bulgaria Lithuania Latvia and Estonia expelled a total of 20 Russian embassy staffers in connection with activities contrary to their diplomatic status. Russia has tended to respond to such decisions with reciprocal moves and earlier today announced the expulsion of 10 diplomats from Estonia Latvia and Lithuania.

Ukraine war: Five wounded after explosions hit western city of Lviv,Lviv has become a hub for thousands of refugees fleeing other parts of Ukraine since Russia's invasion.,Ukraine war: Five wounded after explosions hit western city of Lviv Published 26 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Thick black smoke could be seen rising from the area that was hit on the outskirts of Lviv Several explosions hit the city of Lviv in western Ukraine regional officials said. The governor of the Lviv region Maksym Kozytskyi said five people had been injured and that rocket fire had hit a fuel storage facility and a factory. Lviv has so far escaped much of the shelling that has come to be a part of daily life in other parts of Ukraine. It has also become a hub for hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing other parts of the country. The alleged Russian attack came as US President Joe Biden delivered a speech in Warsaw Poland some 250 miles (400km) from Lviv. In it he addressed the Russian people on their leader President Vladimir Putin telling them: For God\s sake this man cannot remain in power. The Kremlin responded that was not for the US leader to say. That\s not for Biden to decide. The president of Russia is elected by Russians a spokesman said. A White House official later said that Mr Biden was not calling for regime change but making the point that Vladimir Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours in the region. Lviv\s mayor Andriy Sadoviy said that with today\s blows the aggressor sends greetings to President Biden who is in Poland Reuters news agency reports. In other developments in Ukraine today: The city of Slavutych where many of Chernobyls nuclear power plants workers live was taken by Russian troops according to the regional governor. Local residents waved Ukrainian flags and sang patriotic songs in protest Russian forces fired at a nuclear research facility in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv according to Ukraines parliament. It said it was unable to assess the extent of the damage to the site because of the continued Russian shelling of the city Another Russian general Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was killed in a strike near the southern city of Kherson said Ukraines defence ministry Nobody really cares By Hugo Bachega BBC News Lviv First mid-afternoon the air raid sirens went off. Then three powerful explosions and thick plumes of smoke could be seen from the distance. Hours later another attack. It all happened a day after Russia said it was focusing its invasion of Ukraine on the east. Lviv is in the extreme opposite. And this distance from the worst of Russias aggression where people have been under unrelenting bombing and shelling turned this city into something like a safe heaven. Displaced people humanitarian workers volunteers. They are all here. That perception could be changing. Maryanna Pack a 39-year-old economist who was near the site of the blast gave a passionate testimony that may be a view shared by many. We\re feeling unprotected. Nobody really cares about what\s happening here she said. We need more help now. Eastern Ukraine has been completely destroyed. It\s really possible that could happen to Lviv and the west of the country too. Image caption Maryanna Pack who saw the explosion said we need more help now As bombs fell on Lviv and other cities across Ukraine President Biden referred to his Russian counterpart as a butcher. The comment was made during a meeting with Ukrainian refugees helping with the humanitarian relief effort in Poland - where more than two million Ukrainian refugees have now fled. A spokesperson for Mr Putin cited by Russian state news agency Tass said the comment narrowed the prospects for mending ties between the two countries. Earlier Mr Biden met Ukraines foreign and defence ministers Dmytro Kuleba and Oleksii Reznikov. The two Ukrainians ministers trip out of Ukraine to Poland was seen as a possible sign that confidence in Ukraines fightback against Russia is growing. During the talks the US\s unwavering commitment to Ukraine\s sovereignty and territorial integrity was discussed according to a US state department spokesperson. Mr Biden also stressed the sacred commitment to Nato\s collective defence after meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda. You can count on that... for your freedom and ours he told Mr Duda.]

Ukraine daily round-up: Abramovich suffered suspected poisoning at talks,The Chelsea FC owner - who has now recovered - reportedly suffered sore eyes and peeling skin.,Ukraine daily round-up: Abramovich suffered suspected poisoning at talks Published 5 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption The Chelsea FC owner has now recovered sources say It was another day of busy developments in Ukraine on Monday - with one story grabbing immediate attention. Sources close to the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich said he had suffered symptoms of a suspected poisoning following peace talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border earlier this month. The Chelsea FC owner - who has now recovered - reportedly suffered sore eyes and peeling skin. A report in the Wall Street Journal said the alleged poisoning was orchestrated by hardliners in Russia who wanted to sabotage the talks. Both Ukrainian and American officials have played down the reports. However our security correspondent Frank Gardner says it would hardly be surprising that the US would want to dampen down suggestions that anyone - especially Russia - had used a chemical weapon in Ukraine as this could push them into retaliatory action that they are extremely reluctant to take. You can read the full story here: Abramovich suffered suspected poisoning at talks Zelensky open to neutrality in talks IMAGE SOURCE HO VIA EPA Image caption Zelensky said any such deal would have to be put to a referendum in Ukraine Earlier in the day President Volodymyr Zelensky said his government was prepared to discuss adopting a neutral status as part of a peace deal with Russia. Neutrality means a country does not ally itself militarily with others. In an interview with independent Russian journalists Mr Zelensky said any such deal would have to be put to a referendum in Ukraine. He has made similar comments before but rarely so forcefully. The news comes as the negotiations between the two countries are set to resume on Tuesday in Turkey. Security guarantees and neutrality non-nuclear status of our state. We are ready to go for it. This is the most important point Mr Zelensky said in the 90-minute video call. Read more here. Anti-war Russians intimidated on their doorsteps IMAGE SOURCE DARYA KHEIKINEN Image caption Darya Kheikinens apartment door was vandalised two nights in a row Russian activists and journalists speaking out against their country\s so-called special military operation in Ukraine have had their homes vandalised by unknown pro-Kremlin figures. Apartment doors have been daubed with threatening graffiti labelling the people inside a traitor with messages featuring the letter Z - a pro-Kremlin symbol of Russia\s war in Ukraine. Other examples are even more extreme. In one case a leading Russian journalist discovered a pigs head wearing a wig on his doorstep with an anti-Semitic sticker stuck to his door. Alexei Venediktov the long-time editor of radio station Ekho of Moscow before it stopped broadcasting due to increased Russian censorship posted photos of the vandalism pointing out the irony of an anti-Semitic attack happening in the country that defeated fascism. Such vandalism is a sign of the increasingly intimidating atmosphere in Russia for those people who publicly express their opposition to the war in Ukraine. Read the story in full here. Russia accused of transferring thousands of civilians IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption Dozens of refugees are now housed in a sports centre in Taganrog Russia east of Mariupol Ukraine accused Russia of forcibly relocating thousands of civilians from Mariupol the strategic port city devastated by Russian shelling. Russia is housing an estimated 5000 at a temporary camp in Bezimenne east of Mariupol seen in satellite images. Ukraines Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said 40000 had been moved from Ukraine to Russian-held territory without any co-ordination with Kyiv. A Mariupol refugee now in Russia said: All of us were taken forcibly. Some Ukrainian officials describe Russia\s actions as deportations to filtration camps - an echo of Russia\s war in Chechnya when thousands of Chechens were brutally interrogated in makeshift camps and many disappeared.

Civilians trapped in Chernihiv IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption A school building that was partially destroyed by Russian shelling in the city earlier this month The northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv has been almost completely encircled by Russian forces and left without electricity gas or running water. Tens of thousands of people remain trapped. Some have described civilian buildings and residential areas being deliberately targeted. The strikes are so frequent that Anna and her husband take turns in watching the sky. He does the nights she does the mornings. The attacks are extremely loud. The building and windows shake a lot she said. It is impossible to sleep. Only when you\re exhausted because your brain just turns off. The couple and probably everyone else left in Chernihiv spend most of their time hiding behind thick walls. Thank God we have them Anna said. Their son who is 12 rarely ventures outside. He\s in panic. Many children are afraid of going out. Chernihiv located on the banks of the Desna River was one of the first targets for Russian troops who invaded Ukraine from Belarus hoping to quickly reach the capital Kyiv just 144km (90 miles) to the south. A month on that has not happened and they have now effectively surrounded the city. Civilians are trapped with no running water electricity and heating and under relentless bombing and shelling. And like Mariupol the besieged city on the Sea of Azov that has seen the worst of Russias brutality very little seems to remain untouched. Read the full story here.

The company said it restricted customer access to protect military users and critical infrastructure. Global internet monitor Netblocks said it was the most severe disruption to affect Ukrtelecom since Russias invasion of Ukraine started last month. Netblocks said it saw a collapse in connectivity to 13% of pre-war levels. However Ukrainian users on different internet providers who spoke to the BBC reported no problems. Ukrtelecom says it is the countrys biggest provider of fixed internet in terms of geographical coverage but second after Kyivstar in terms of number of clients. It told the BBC it had been operating at about 80% of its full coverage because of damage caused by the Russian invasion. In a statement Ukrtelecom chief executive Yuriy Kurmaz wrote that a powerful enemy cyber attack was carried out on Ukrtelecoms IT infrastructure. In order to protect the critical network infrastructure and not interrupt services to the Armed Forces other military bodies and users of critical infrastructure we were forced to temporarily restrict internet access to most private users and business customers he added. Mr Kurmaz said the attack had been successfully repulsed and the provision of services was being gradually resumed. IMAGE SOURCE UKRTELECOM Image caption Ukrtelecom engineers have kept working during the conflict Yuriy Shchyhol head of Ukraines State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection said that its specialists had responded quickly to the situation and had driven-back the attack. Before the company revealed details of the incident Alp Toker director of Netblocks told the BBC they had observed users falling offline progressively over the course of the day which indicates that the issue lies not with cabling or interconnections but rather with central infrastructure at the operator\s data centre. This can indicate a cyber-attack. ⚠️ Update: Ukraines national internet provider Ukrtelecom has confirmed a cyberattack on its core infrastructure.  Real-time network data show an ongoing and intensifying nation-scale disruption to service which is the most severe registered since the invasion by Russia. https://t.co/syej0wABYO — NetBlocks (@netblocks) March 28 2022 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Ukraine defence: Red lights and painted arrows fuel fear of Russian agents,"Fear of Russian saboteurs operating in Ukraine has soared, but is it based on intelligence and arrests?",Ukraine defence: Red lights and painted arrows fuel fear of Russian agents By Andrew Harding BBC News Odesa Ukraine Published 26 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption Bohdan had to make a police statement after a neighbour reported his fairy lights Suspicion thrives on conflict and after a month of war in Ukraine the fear that Russian saboteurs may be operating is hardening into a certainty. But how much is fact backed up by intelligence reports and arrests and how much is something closer to understandable paranoia fuelled by social media rumours about mysterious lights and signs? It was my neighbours from this stairwell who came to see me. They were scared about security said Bohdan Mylko a 22-year-old engineer sharing an apartment on the northern edge of Odesa. Fifteen minutes later the police were at his door asking about a red light in his bedroom window. It\s paranoia based on fake news about red lights being a sign to the Russians. I had to go to the police station and get my documents checked make a statement and get my photo taken. The police realised that I\m just a normal guy and let me go home. I\m not trying to help the Russians said Mylko holding up the set of flashing fairy lights that prompted the police\s intervention. Image caption Elderly people are among patrols at night asking to check the documents of people they encounter Moments after we visited him one evening shortly before curfew we were stopped on the street outside by a group of residents who asked to see our documents. You could be Russians said an elderly woman who gave her name as Valya. What are you doing here? We have small children. We don\t want anything to happen to them. Maybe someone will drop a bomb here tomorrow said another woman as the wail of an air raid siren rose over the apartment complex. Such concerns are understandable in a city and a country still reeling from the shock of Russias invasion. Similar behaviour has been noted in many other conflicts from Syria to Chechnya and beyond. This is not paranoia. There are Russian agents and citizens of Ukraine working against us. That\s a fact said Capt Volodymir Kalina from the Odesa police. But he acknowledged there was a strong element of disinformation involved and accused Russia of deliberately trying to stir up public fear. They\re trying to distract us to make us pay attention to the wrong places - to clear us from one part of the city so they can carry out their work in another area he said. Image caption Dmitro covered a black arrow on a wall in case it was a sign for Russian troops Along the coast a few kilometres south of Odesa citys historic centre in an area known for its nightclubs and beach bars retired businessman Dmitro Novak 71 was beginning his morning shift with a neighbourhood patrol. He pointed to a black arrow painted on a wall and explained he had covered it in case it was a sign for Russian troops. A few minutes later he stopped on a set of steps beside a large empty office building overlooking the sea. I saw a big light there. It was directed towards the night sky. My neighbours saw it too. It was on the roof of this building. For sure it was a signal to the Russian fleet. Some kind of signal. We called the authorities and they came immediately and the light was switched off. So now we\re looking carefully around for any other signals or marks. Everybody is alert. We\re changing shifts every two hours said Novak. Last week Russian naval artillery shelled the area with some missiles landing just off the beach and several others hitting residential homes but causing no casualties. Image caption Ukrainian media has broadcast numerous videos showing police arresting alleged Russian saboteurs Hanna Shelest a prominent analyst in Odesa who advises the Ukrainian parliament on security issues backed up concerns that Ukrainians or Russians were providing information to the Russian military. The first aim is the storage of weapons and ammunition in town in case street fighting starts here she explained. The second is to spread disinformation and gossip. The third aim is to mark directions in the city with signs for which way to go in case there is an amphibious landing by the Russians. And the fourth is to mark targets - either visually or with electronic signals - for artillery or airstrikes. Ukrainian media has broadcast numerous videos showing police arresting alleged Russian saboteurs. President Volodymyr Zelensky was also shown handing out medals to a group of police security agents credited with apprehending suspected Russian saboteurs and reconnaissance groups. But it is worth noting that for all the fear and suspicion aroused by such reports the evidence so far suggests that a few isolated Russian cells have so far been remarkably unsuccessful and that Ukrainian public opinion - directly contradicting Russian propaganda - has hardened and united against the Kremlins invasion. The idea that partisans or fifth columnists might be activated effectively in Ukraine would appear to have been entirely fanciful. Ukraine\s security services are definitely monitoring those under suspicion. And we already know some people have been arrested. But as for anything more serious - it is probably not their time yet said Dr Shelest.

Ukraine crisis: Why India is buying more Russian oil,"Imports of cheaper Russian oil by India are rising, despite calls for Russia's economic isolation.",Ukraine crisis: Why India is buying more Russian oil By Shruti Menon BBC Reality Check Published 5 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Rising global oil prices are a concern for Indias policymakers Russia is seeking new markets for its oil exports as Western sanctions tighten - and India has been taking advantage of discounted prices to ramp up imports from the country. The US has said that although these oil imports do not violate sanctions support for Russia...is support for an invasion that obviously is having a devastating impact. Where does India get its oil? After the US and China India is the worlds third-largest consumer of oil over 80% of which is imported. In 2021 India bought about 12 million barrels of oil from Russia only 2% of its total imports. By far the largest supplies last year came from the Middle East with significant quantities also from the US and Nigeria. In January and February India didnt import any oil from Russia. But contracts for March and April have already reached six million barrels according to data compiled by Kpler a commodities research group. The Indian government says even if it buys more oil from Russia it would still be a drop literally a drop in a larger bucket of its oil imports globally. Whats the deal India is getting? Following its invasion of Ukraine there are now fewer buyers for Russias Ural crude oil and its price has fallen. While we don\t know the exact price that India is paying the Urals discount to Brent crude the global benchmark] in the last week has widened to about $30 per barrel says Matt Smith an analyst at Kpler. These two types of crude normally sell at a similar price. But at one point in March as the price of Urals continued to drop the difference between them reached an all-time record he adds. So India and China are likely to purchase at least some of this Russian] crude at a significant discount he says. Can the world manage without Russian oil and gas? IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption India imports more than 80% of its oil Whats the impact of financial sanctions? Indias big refining companies are facing a challenge trying to finance these discounted purchases because of sanctions on Russian banks. Its a problem facing trade in both directions. Financial analysts Bloomberg estimate that Indian exporters to Russia are currently awaiting payments equivalent to about $500m (£381.5m). One of the options India is looking at is a transaction system based on local currencies where Indian exporters to Russia get paid in roubles instead of dollars or euros. Where else is India looking to buy oil? Indias oil imports from the US have gone up significantly since February according to analysts at Refinitiv. However market analysts say this may not be sustainable in the future as the US seeks to use its domestic oil production to replace supplies from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. There are also suggestions that trade with Iran could resume under a barter mechanism which Indian oil refiners could use to buy its oil. This arrangement stopped three years ago when the US reimposed sanctions on Iran. But this is unlikely to resume without a wider deal reached in international negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme.

Ukraine war: Odesa defies Russia and embraces signs of life,Residents of the historic city on Ukraine's coast are confident it will not fall to Russian forces.,Ukraine war: Odesa defies Russia and embraces signs of life By Andrew Harding BBC News Odesa Ukraine Published 5 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE BBC NEWS Amid the whining air raid sirens the checkpoints neighbourhood patrols and enduring fears of Russian attacks - from the sea air or land - the historic and cosmopolitan Ukrainian resort city of Odesa is gently trying to reconnect with its famously relaxed holiday spirit as if embracing it were a form of defiance against the Kremlin. Music is life. When music is silenced anything can happen. Music is a way of protecting our minds said Olexandr Proletarskyi a music critic sitting on a bar stool in a dark cellar venue near the city centre. But the recent reopening of clubs beach restaurants and nail salons across Odesa is not simply an expression of defiance or an economic necessity. It also reflects growing local confidence in the course of the war against Russia at least here on the Black Sea coast. The city is coming alive I feel. I think the fear is going away a bit. People believe in our army which is protecting us and feel comfortable feel safe. I don\t think the Russian army is winning said Alexander Hodosevich a drummer for an instrumental psychedelic band sitting with a group of friends after finishing an hour-long set at the More Music club. The venue has just reopened staging live (and live-streamed) concerts in the late afternoons to give audiences enough time to get home before curfew. IMAGE SOURCE BBC NEWS Image caption Bars restaurants and clubs are re-opening in Odesa North of the city on windswept beach popular with summer tourists razor wire land mines and sandbags now block all access to the sea. I\ve seen Russian ships. But they pulled back. They know we\re a threat to them. We\ve had a lot of incoming fire. From rockets over there. There have also been drones dropping bombs. But they won\t succeed here. Let them try to land - we\ll make them pay a heavy price said Anatolii 27 a Ukrainian soldier manning an anti-aircraft gun. There is a logic to Odesas growing confidence. Russias advance along the Black Sea coast has stalled. Ukrainian troops in the city of Mykolaiv have not only protected their strategic bridge but are now reported to be pushing Russian forces back to the east. In Kherson the first city to be seized by Russian troops a month ago occupying security forces are now being accused of using excessive force against civilian protesters and of abducting or arresting local leaders to try to contain popular unrest. When they started using this gas smoke pellets and stun grenades I started running. That was really scary said Lada Danik a university lecturer in Kherson speaking on a Skype call. The Russians] started kidnapping people going to their apartments and the places people live - protesters and activists. It seems they\re using more threatening techniques and tactics. I think they\re in panic she said. In Odesa there is enormous gratitude for the way Ukrainian soldiers in places like Mykolaiv and Voznesensk have stood their ground and blocked Russian land forces from moving further west. But what about an amphibious landing? The small town which blocked Russias big plans The security analyst Hanna Shelest believes that Odesa could have fallen to Russia if pro-Moscow leaders had engineered a surrender in the opening days of the war. But that option is now closed and she believes Russian troops would struggle to attack from the sea without first establishing a base on land. It seems to me that it\s just impossible. If you look at the technical conditions the strategic terrain Odesa has never been a city for easy taking (from the sea). History has proved it several times she said. In the meantime the citys vast catacombs - perhaps 2500km (1553 miles) of underground tunnels dug over the course of the past two centuries - are being prepared once again as possible air raid shelters. IMAGE SOURCE BBC NEWS Image caption The catacombs were used by fleeing families during both World Wars Mattresses and food supplies now sit in dark corners in the musty labyrinth-like network which was used by fleeing families and by partisans in both world wars as well as Russias Civil War. There\s graffiti here from the 1940s. This one says \Death to Fascists\ said caver and local historian Maxim Baranestski 46 waving his flashlight at lettering on a sand-coloured stone wall deep underground. But the firm hope in Odesa is that history will not repeat itself and that Russias push west along the coast will remain thwarted. Are you in Ukraine? Do you have relatives or friends who are there?

Zelensky says Ukraine prepared to discuss neutrality in peace talks,Ukraine's president says his country is open to adopting a neutral status as part of a possible peace deal.,Zelensky says Ukraine prepared to discuss neutrality in peace talks Published 5 days ago Share IMAGE SOURCE EPA Ukraines president has said his government is prepared to discuss adopting a neutral status as part of a peace deal with Russia. In an interview with independent Russian journalists Volodymyr Zelensky said any such deal would have to be put to a referendum in Ukraine. He has made similar comments before but rarely so forcefully. The news comes as the negotiations between the two countries are set to resume this week in Turkey. Security guarantees and neutrality non-nuclear status of our state. We are ready to go for it. This is the most important point Mr Zelensky said in the 90-minute video call. Neutrality means a country does not ally itself militarily with others. Mr Zelensky said that any potential agreement would require a face-to-face meeting with President Putin and that effective security guarantees that Ukraine would not come under attack were essential. The Ukrainian leader - speaking in Russian throughout - added that Russias invasion has caused the destruction of Russian-speaking cities in Ukraine. Later in an overnight video address to his nation Mr Zelensky said Ukraine sought peace without delay. Russias President Vladimir Putin has long demanded a neutral Ukraine and guarantees that it would not join the Nato military alliance. After the country achieved independence in 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed it has gradually veered towards the West - to both the EU and Nato. But Russia\s leader aims to reverse that seeing the fall of the Soviet Union as the disintegration of historical Russia. He has claimed Russians and Ukrainians are one people and denied Ukraine its long history. On Sunday the Russian state media regulator Roskomnadzor instructed the press not to publish the interview with Ukraine\s leader and said an investigation has been started in order to identify the level of responsibility and what response will be taken in relation to those who carried out the interview. Roskomnadzor notes some of the media outlets that conducted the interview are designated foreign agents in Russia. The country recently passed new laws restricting the way in which Russian media can report on the war in Ukraine. The interview was published by outlets now based outside Russia. Ukraines military intelligence chief has accused Moscow of seeking to split Ukraine in two mirroring North and South Korea after Russia failed to take control of the whole country. But a senior adviser to President Zelensky Alexander Rodnyansky told the BBC that Ukraine would make no concessions on handing over territory to Russia. We\re certainly not willing to give up any territory or talk about our territorial integrity Mr Rodnyansky told BBC Radio 4\s World at One programme. If you ask the people who live in these areas they wouldn\t want to live in Russia. How can we leave them? Let alone the whole idea of slicing up our country. The possibility of Ukrainian neutrality is not new. Its been discussed by Russian and Ukrainian officials for at least two weeks. But President Zelenskys reference is perhaps the most explicit so far. Clearly theres no room for Nato membership in such a vision of Ukraines future. Removing that aspiration from Ukraines constitution (it was added in 2019) will need to be put to a referendum. With support for membership at an all-time high it will be a bitter pill for many Ukrainians to swallow. The key will be what sort of security guarantees can possibly take the place of being a member of the Western alliance. Ukrainian officials insist that guarantees will need to be much more specific than the 1994 Budapest Memorandum which gave Ukraine security assurances in return for giving up its stock of nuclear weapons. Ukraine will want to know the precise terms under which countries are prepared to come to its defence in the event of further Russian aggression. There are many versions of neutrality. Finding one that meets the competing needs of Kyiv and Moscow will not be simple. And what will Ukraines borders actually be? President Zelensky says Russian troops must retreat to positions held before Moscows full-scale invasion began on 24 February. He says Ukraine will not try and retake the Donbas or Crimea by force but Ukrainian officials are not yet ready simply to give up on territories that have been under Russian control (direct or indirect) since 2014.

Ukraine: Nottinghamshire man taking ambulance to country border,Bill Sharpe is driving the ambulance from the UK to the Ukraine border with Poland.,Ukraine: Nottinghamshire man taking ambulance to country border By Amy Phipps BBC News Published 26 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE BILL SHARPE Image caption Bill Sharpes company funded the purchase of the old NHS ambulance A businessman and his son are preparing to drive an old NHS ambulance filled with medical supplies to the Ukraine border. Bill Sharpe 49 has been collecting donations at his family-run business in Radcliffe-on-Trent Nottinghamshire. Mr Sharpe and Ed will drive the ambulance from the UK to the countrys border with Poland on Friday. They will then hand it over to a local contact to take the much-needed transport and aid into Ukraine. Mr Sharpes company funded the purchase of the old ambulance that he and his 27-year-old son will take turns in driving across Europe. He said former NHS vehicles were usually decommissioned before being sold meaning the equipment and the emergency lights would have been removed. However he said he was able to organise for it to be kept in its original condition due to the nature of where it was going. He said: The main reason for doing this was getting ambulances over there for the soldiers. The contact that we\ve got over there in Ukraine said they were a desperate requirement. So we\re getting them over but filled with aid as well. IMAGE SOURCE BILL SHARPE Image caption Mr Sharpe has filled the ambulance with donated supplies They have been collecting donations of medical equipment womens sanitary products nappies and ready-made baby milk. Mr Sharpe was also hoping to take a defibrillator if he can get one. That\s the kind of \holy grail\ thing that we\d love to be able to get hold of he said. Despite heading towards a war zone Mr Sharpe said he did not have any safety concerns. I\m worried mentally about what it\s going to be like at the other end. It\s obviously not a very nice environment with a lot of displaced unhappy people so I\m a bit apprehensive about that he said. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook Twitter or Instagram.

Ukraine war: Russian officials seize Swiss watches apparently worth millions,"Agents raided a Moscow premises of luxury brand Audemars Piguet, according to a report in Swiss media.",Ukraine war: Russian officials seize Swiss watches apparently worth millions Published 5 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Jewel-encrusted Audemars Piguet watches on display in London this month Russian officials have reportedly confiscated millions of dollars worth of luxury Audemars Piguet watches. The Swiss timepieces were seized from a shop by security service agents on Tuesday for allegedly violating customs rules Swiss media report. It happened just days after Switzerland abandoned its traditional neutrality to join Western countries in imposing sanctions against Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. There is no Swiss confirmation. However the government has said Switzerland\s new luxury export ban has been causing uncertainties for some businesses. Watches from Audemars Piguet can cost more than £700000 ($921000) a piece. The company has not responded to a BBC request for comment. Russia hits back at sanctions with export bans Putin alters law on leased jets to defy sanctions According to Switzerlands NZZ am Sontag newspaper the watches were seized by agents working for Russias FSB security service from a Moscow subsidiary of Audemars Piguet. The agents apparently justified their raid by claiming the watches in question had violated local customs rules when they were being imported to Russia. After the invasion the luxury Swiss brand said it had ceased its operations in Russia and its website describes both of its two boutiques in the capital as temporarily closed. According to industry officials Switzerland exported 260 million Swiss francs ($280m) worth of watches to Russia last year but the market may be worth even more to the Swiss watch sector given the number of Russian customers buying luxury products in Switzerland. Russian officials have shown an increased willingness in the last few weeks to seize property from foreign companies trying to reduce their business dealings in Russia. Hundreds of leased foreign passenger jets worth almost $10bn remain grounded in the country with their owners having had their requests to return the airplanes denied. Earlier this month former President Dmitry Medvedev said that a new law would allow Russia to nationalise the assets of Western companies pulling out of the country.

People gathered in Bath at the weekend to raise funds for charities supporting those caught up in the war in Ukraine. Some said they were fearful people were dying while waiting to get visas enabling them to seek refuge in the UK. The Home Office said it was doing everything possible to ensure a rapid service.

I have family in East Ukraine in quite a dangerous location near the power station she said. Luckily thankfully we got visas for Olesksandr to come and stay with us here. The application form is really complex and confusing she added. There is a mixture of questions about sponsors and applicants and everyone makes mistakes. There\s no way you can deal with it. It takes about an hour to fill in one form with me on the phone with someone talking me through. Image caption A small number of people gathered for the demonstration Jura Everauskite who also attended the demonstration on Saturday said she did not want the public to forget that war is happening. The visas scheme in the UK is just unacceptable. People have to wait weeks for their visas while people are dying she said. We want to protest that. It doesn\t make sense.

War in Ukraine: The danger of wishful Western thinking,"With Russia still a powerful force, wide-eyed realism is what Ukraine needs from the US and Europe.",War in Ukraine: The danger of wishful Western thinking By Katty Kay US special correspondent Published 25 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption A man walks away from a building hit by Russian fire in Kharkiv on 25 March In the second episode of Volodymyr Zelensky\s very funny comedy series The Servant of the People one of the spooky bad guys says of Zelensky\s character the newly elected President of Ukraine: He\s known for being iron clad and brave. That was the point I reached for the remote pressed pause and took a deep breath. The 2015 series has just starting airing here in America and for those of us who are new to it its a bit surreal. Every time you catch yourself chuckling you then start to feel sad. Its emotionally draining. I find I cant watch more than an episode at a time and I do so with a certain dread. Friends have told me they cant watch it at all. And its not because its bad. Its a good show and Zelensky is a talented actor. Hes charming and self-deprecating. No its hard to watch because we fear whats going to happen to the real President of Ukraine. There\s another scene in that same episode where the new president Vasyl Petrovych Holoborodko is introduced to his security detail body double. A smarmy political flunky turns from the double to Zelensky and says He\ll die from a sniper bullet for you then he laughs out loud at Zelensky\s look of horror. But the flunky chortles I think it won\t come to that. And then your stomach turns because right now it feels like the whole Western world is watching Ukraine and just praying that it wont indeed come to that. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visiting wounded Ukrainian troops on 13 March No-one would wish any of this suffering on Ukraine. But for the moment Zelensky and the brave people he leads are heroes in a world that has been short of them. Weve come out of a dark period of ugly political division and tragic medical crisis and we are longing for something good to believe in. Forty four million brave Ukrainians seem to have risen to the challenge and given us cause for hope in the power of the underdog. We root for them. We are amazed by their resilience. We long for them to survive and stay free. So its understandable that we may fall victim to what one analyst eloquently described as Western wishful thinking.

READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis After the invasion one US senator told me confidently that whatever happened the Ukrainian people would be free. It was the optimism Ive come to expect and appreciate from US politicians. And we hope it will be true. History reminds us however that good doesnt always prevail. Not against Russia anyway. Ask the Syrians still stuck under the boot of the Assad regime their cities destroyed by Russian bombs. Ask the Chechens who saw their capital flattened on the orders of Vladimir Putin. Or ask the countless brave Arabs Iranians Belarusians and Myanmarese who risked their lives to protest against oppressive rulers with little to show for it. In the suburbs of Ukraine that have become Putins latest battlefield David has indeed given Goliath an almighty shock. But make no mistake Russia is still a daunting adversary. One senior European diplomat who understands Putin is convinced that the Russian president has no interest in negotiating any settlement. Rather he thinks Putin is using this moment to regroup and resupply ready for another potentially more devastating assault. Were hopeful Westerners at risk of underestimating Russias military chances I asked? Yes he nodded. Image caption Ukraine campaign map on 24 March Russias military boasts 900000 active duty troops and two million reservists - more than eight times that of Ukraine. It still has a massive arsenal and a satellite state in Belarus from which it can draw more troops as well as the ability to recruit mercenaries from countries like Georgia or Syria. It has cyber warfare capabilities it has not yet fully unleashed. It has 4500 nuclear weapons it has threatened to use and chemical weapons that the West has warned it might. The Russians have performed much worse than anyone expected but they have made some territorial gains making slow but steady progress around Mariupol and threatening to cut off Ukrainian forces near the breakaway eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Often this progress has come by flattening civilian neighbourhoods. Ignoring or diminishing those gains or the remaining power of the Russian military wont help Ukraine. Indeed it could hurt it. The Ukrainians success depends on two things their own phenomenal courage and just as critical the steady supply of military hardware that its getting from Western countries. If those countries or the public in those countries start for a moment to think David has beaten Goliath then the flow of weapons could slow or stop. That would be catastrophic for the Ukrainian resistance. President Biden has spent this week in Europe shoring up the Western alliance. But theres a growing recognition this fight will go on for longer than either Russia or the West anticipated. The Ukrainians may need arms supplies for months to come. The alliance will need to keep its resolve in order to match Putins determination. This is no time to be unrealistic. Wide-eyed realism will help Zelensky more than wishful thinking.]
War in Ukraine: Change of emphasis or admission of failure by Moscow?,"Moscow now says the main aim is to ""liberate"" eastern Ukraine - a change of emphasis or more?",War in Ukraine: Change of emphasis or admission of failure by Moscow? By Paul Adams BBC News Published 25 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Kharkiv has been pounded for weeks - now that Russian firepower may be deployed further east Is the Russian military having to change its plans? Perhaps even reduce the scale of Moscows ambitions in Ukraine? Its probably too early to tell but theres definitely a shift in emphasis. A top Russian general - Sergey Rudskoy - says the first stage of what President Vladimir Putin calls Russia\s special military operation has been mostly accomplished and that Russian forces will now concentrate on the complete liberation of the Donbas. This is likely to mean a more concerted effort to push beyond the line of contact that separates Ukrainian government-held territory in the east of the country from the Russian-backed separatist people\s republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. The pace of Russias advance in other areas of Ukraine remains glacial. Its forces have been pushed back from positions around the capital Kyiv and are said to have started digging defensive positions to avoid losing more or prepare for some kind of pause. Next stop Kyiv - the battle on the capitals outskirts Defiant troops tell Russians: Go home while youre still alive Its probably way too early to conclude that Russia has given up on capturing Kyiv but Western officials say that Russia continues to experience setback after setback. On Friday they said Russia had lost another general - the seventh - and that morale was at rock bottom in some units. They believe General Rudskoys announcement implies that Moscow knows that its ambitious pre-war strategy has failed. Russia is recognising that it can\t pursue its operations on multiple axes simultaneously one official said. As many as 10 new Russian battalion tactical groups are being generated officials say and are heading for the Donbas. Even before the war began last month they voiced the fear that Russia would make a concerted effort to encircle and envelop Ukraines best fighting units which make up the Joint Forces Operation (JFO) stationed along the line of contact. Retreat may not mean tame ambitions A renewed push now could see Russian troops pushing out into so-far unconquered areas of Donetsk and Luhansk possibly aiming to link up with forces moving south from Kharkiv and Izyum. And if Russia can succeed in finally pacifying the port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov then other forces could move north and complete the encirclement of the JFO. Some of these objectives still seem out of reach. Mariupols defenders are putting up a ferocious fight preventing Russia from fully achieving another of its pre-war ambitions - a land bridge from the Crimean Peninsula to the Donbas. But if Moscow has concluded that it makes more sense to concentrate for the time being on achieving one objective at a time its likely to concentrate its firepower especially from the air. The Ukrainian military disciplined and motivated as it is will need all the help it can get to withstand the pressure. I hope that\s where the Western supply of arms will make a significant contribution to Ukrainian forces one Western official said. If the coming days do see a shift of focus to the Donbas that doesnt yet mean that Moscow has abandoned its wider ambitions. We don\t see a re-evaluation of the invasion as a whole a senior US defence official said.

Ukraine: UK lawyer appointed to probe war crime claims,"The former International Criminal Court judge will advise Ukraine's prosecutor, attorney general says.",Ukraine: UK lawyer appointed to probe war crime claims By Harriet Agerholm BBC News Published 6 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin has been accused of violating international law including targeting civilians The UKs attorney general has appointed a war crimes lawyer to advise Ukraine over the Russian invasion. Suella Braverman said Sir Howard Morrison would become an independent adviser to Ukraines chief prosecutor Iryna Venediktova. Sir Howard served as a judge on the International Criminal Court in The Hague for more than 12 years. It comes as Russian forces continue to be accused of violating international law by targeting civilians. Could Putin be prosecuted for war crimes? Are Russias attacks war crimes? Earlier this month Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of committing war crimes after it launched air strikes in Kharkiv that hit an opera house a concert hall and government offices. The ICCs chief prosecutor later said evidence was being collected on whether the Russian military had committed war crimes crimes against humanity and genocide. But Russia is not a member of the ICC so any Russian nationals indicted by the court would have to be extradited by the Kremlin. Asked by MPs in the House of Commons on Thursday about alternative ways of prosecuting war criminals other than the ICC the attorney general said all options are on the table although she insisted the ICC was the UK\s preferred option. I will always defer and support my counterpart in Ukraine the prosecutor general in terms of my efforts to support her in terms of her choice of route for redress she said. But whilst we welcome the focus on accountability we do believe that the ICC is the right place for those responsible for committing these atrocious crimes in Ukraine to be held accountable for their actions. Announcing Sir Howard\s appointment Ms Braverman said the UK was committed to showing that the atrocities we see being committed day after day in Ukraine will not be forgotten. Ms Venediktova welcomed Sir Howard\s help saying his experience and knowledge of international criminal law speaks louder than words. During his time as a judge Sir Howard oversaw cases such as that of the Serbian war criminal Radovan Karadzic. The attorney generals office said Ms Braverman was in regular communication with Ukraines prosecutor general and they planned to meet in person next month. On a trip to The Hague last week Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab accused Mr Putin of responding in ever more barbaric ways in Ukraine and offered the ICC financial and technical help for prosecuting alleged war crimes in the country. Boris Johnson has used similar language describing the Russian military under Mr Putin\s orders of using barbaric and indiscriminate tactics. Russia denies targeting civilians and says it is carrying out a military operation against neo-Nazis in Ukraine.

War in Ukraine: Anti-war Russians intimidated on their doorsteps,The doors of Russian journalists and activists who speak out against the war are being vandalised.,War in Ukraine: Anti-war Russians intimidated on their doorsteps By Ben Tobias BBC News Published 6 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE DARYA KHEIKINEN Image caption Darya Kheikinens apartment door was vandalised two nights in a row. Russian activists and journalists speaking out against their country\s so-called special military operation in Ukraine have had their homes vandalised by unknown pro-Kremlin figures. Apartment doors have been daubed with threatening graffiti labelling the people inside a traitor with messages featuring the letter Z - a pro-Kremlin symbol of Russia\s war in Ukraine. Other examples are even more extreme. In one case a leading Russian journalist discovered a pigs head wearing a wig on his doorstep with an anti-Semitic sticker stuck to his door. Alexei Venediktov the long-time editor of radio station Ekho of Moscow before it stopped broadcasting due to increased Russian censorship posted photos of the vandalism pointing out the irony of an anti-Semitic attack happening in the country that defeated fascism. Such vandalism is a sign of the increasingly intimidating atmosphere in Russia for those people who publicly express their opposition to the war in Ukraine. Manure on the doorstep When Darya Kheikinen looked through the peephole on the door of her St Petersburg apartment she noticed it had been painted red on the outside. She guessed straight away what had happened - there had been similar instances with other activists. She opened the door to find the word traitor scrawled in large red letters across the outside several pieces of paper with messages such as a traitor to the motherland lives here pinned to her home and a pile of manure on the mat at her feet. IMAGE SOURCE DARYA KHEIKINEN Image caption Darya Kheikinen found a pile of manure on her doorstep two days in a row It probably happened because of my public anti-war statements and opposition views Ms Kheikinen a well-known political activist told the BBC adding that the same thing happened to three other St Petersburg activists at the same time. It happened again the next morning - but only to her this time. The door was covered in green dye and there was spray foam in the lock. There were signs reading \we will not forgive Nazism\ and \a Finnish Nazi lives here\ she said pointing out that her surname is Finnish. The messages reflect the Kremlin\s false claims that Ukraine\s government is run by Nazis and its operation in Ukraine is necessary to denazify the country. Ms Kheikinen doesnt know who was responsible for the attack but said as far as she knows the only people who have her address are her parents and the police. I can\t say that it has scared me she said. Actually I find it amusing. Imagine some idiot dragging a bag of manure up the stairs to the 11th floor - and doing it two nights in a row! Scum and traitors Since Russia\s war in Ukraine began life for those who oppose it has become increasingly difficult. The government passed a law threatening people who spread fake information about the war with 15 years in prison. Vladimir Putin and other politicians have painted any opposition to the war as a betrayal of the country. Any people and especially the Russian people will always be able to distinguish the true patriots from the scum and the traitors and just spit them out like a fly that accidentally flew into their mouth the president said in a speech on 16 March. He went on to claim that the West is trying to destroy Russia by using fifth columnists - meaning enemies within - to provoke civil confrontation. IMAGE SOURCE DMITRY IVANOV Image caption Don\t betray the motherland Dima warns a message on Dmitry Ivanov\s door Just a few hours after that speech student activist Dmitry Ivanov whose anti-war opinions are a major feature of his Telegram channel with nearly 10000 followers received a call from his mother asking if he had seen the graffiti all over the door to their landing. It said \don\t betray the motherland Dima\ he told the BBC. There were also three large Zs making it clear the message related to Russia\s actions in Ukraine. The neighbours probably weren\t that surprised he said explaining that his political opinions are no secret because the police turn up at his door every now and then to warn him against attending protests. The doors of three other activists and journalists in Moscow were also vandalised that evening. But Mr Ivanov whose activism began by reporting on a protest against a noisy fan-zone directly outside his university during the 2018 football World Cup in Russia said the attack hasnt put him off. The actions of the police frighten me much more. They have the resources and power to ruin people\s lives but this - this is just minor hooliganism. He decided not to report the vandalism to the police because he didnt want to end up on the wrong side of them he said. Incidents like these might be minor but they are the product of a political environment where you either support the war or are labelled a traitor. The consequences for those who oppose Russias actions in Ukraine are wide-ranging and can include losing your job or even criminal prosecution. But Mr Ivanov says that despite the danger his opposition will continue. The threat of 15 years in jail worries me. But the war is much more scary. This completely destructive senseless cruelty carried out by our country in our name - it is just a huge shock. IMAGE SOURCE .

Army boss raises partition fears: Ukraine round-up,Ukraine's military intelligence chief fears a Korea-style outcome as Biden's jab at Putin makes further waves.,Army boss raises partition fears: Ukraine round-up Published 6 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Russian troops have so far failed to subdue the whole of Ukraine Ukraine\s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov has warned that Russia is trying to apply what he called the Korean scenario to Ukraine having failed to take the capital and depose the legitimate government. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin would try to impose a demarcation line separating the eastern and southern regions from the rest of Ukraine since he would not be able to absorb the whole country. Gen Budanov predicted this quasi-state would be unviable given the resistance of the local population. He said that what he described as a total Ukrainian guerrilla safari was about to open. The generals warning came amid continued reaction to US President Joe Bidens speech in Poland on Saturday in which he said that Mr Putin should not be allowed to remain in power. Media caption Joe Bidens speech on Saturday has had continuing repercussions Mr Bidens Secretary of State Antony Blinken denied that the US had any plans to bring about regime change in Russia or anywhere else. And French President Emmanuel Macron warned against the verbal escalation of the war in Ukraine saying this would make it impossible to bring about a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops. But this isnt the first time President Biden has veered off-script and thrown a live grenade into an otherwise well-prepared measured speech. Is that a strength - saying what many of his citizens are thinking - or a weakness? Our North America reporter Anthony Zurcher takes a look at President Bidens habit of going off-book. Claims of forced deportation IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption Dozens of refugees are now housed in a sports centre in Taganrog Russia east of Mariupol All of us were taken forcibly a refugee from Ukraine\s besieged city of Mariupol says - from Russia where they now are. Ukraine accuses Russia of forcibly deporting its people from war-ravaged cities to Russian-held territory or all the way to Russia proper. Satellite images show a temporary camp east of Mariupol that is housing an estimated 5000 people. Forcibly deporting civilians is seen as an international human rights abuse - but Russia denies it is doing anything of the sort. But what choice do people have when they are in danger or are warned of an incoming missile strike if they remain where they are? Laurence Peter looks at the stories of people who say soldiers have sent them into Russia. Ukraine rejects breakaway referendum plan Ukraine has described plans by the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peoples Republic to hold a referendum on joining Russia as having no legal basis. Ukraines foreign ministry spokesman said any referendum would be fake and warned that Moscow would face further isolation if it went ahead. Earlier the leader of Luhansk said a vote could happen soon and that the population would vote overwhelmingly to leave Ukraine and join Russia. He later rowed back on that statement Tass reports to clarify that he had only been stating a personal opinion - and that no preparations were actually being made for such a vote. Last month Russia formally recognised the Luhansk and Donetsk breakaway republics as independent states paving the way for Russian troops invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine: Medical students back in India left in the lurch,Students face an uncertain future as completing their medical degree remains a challenge.,Ukraine: Medical students back in India left in the lurch By Arunoday Mukharji BBC News Delhi Published 6 days ago Share IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption More than 18000 Indian students were studying medicine in Ukraine before the war began Sooraj Kumar is back with his family in Babuapur village in the central Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The 26-year-old was one of the more than 18000 Indian students studying medicine in Ukraine who were evacuated after the war began. Mr Kumar was in a medical school in Uzhhorod for the past six years and would have qualified as a doctor in three months. Mr Kumar now stares at an uncertain future - he is unable to continue his studies or find a place in Indian colleges. The dream of becoming a doctor for thousands of young Indians begins from small towns and villages. But aspirants have always far outnumbered the vacancies available at affordable government-run colleges. Private medical colleges are accessible to only those who can afford very high fees. In 2021 over 1.5 million students appeared for qualifying exams to government colleges but less than 6% managed to get admission. According to Public Health Foundation of India a think tank only one out of every 11 candidates in 2014 got into medical colleges. Last year the number had increased to one out of every 19 candidates. Dismal results So you have an increase in the number of people wanting to be admitted but the seats have not risen proportionately. As a result a large number of students look for outside avenues says president of the foundation K Srinath Reddy. A farmers son Mr Kumar was studying to be the first doctor not just in the family but in his entire village. Since he could not get admission in a government college heading to Ukraine was the next affordable option. I would have had to pay nearly $150000 (£113000) in a private Indian medical college but in Ukraine it cost me around $30000 for the entire six-year course. Still] I took a huge loan and my father had to sell some of our ancestral land to fund my studies] Mr Kumar said. For medical students with a foreign degree there is one final hurdle - clearing a qualifying exam to practice in India. The percentage of success in these exams have been fairly dismal says Dr Reddy. Between 2015 and 2018 the pass percentage was only 19%. In 2019 it went up to 25% but it came down to 16% in 2020. IMAGE SOURCE SWATI SAGARIKA SABAT Image caption Swati Sagarika Sabat has been attending online classes organised by her university on her phone He said the teaching system abroad didn\t adequately prepare students to Indian medical practices. Now as students return from Ukraine leaving their studies mid-way there is uncertainty. I worry without a degree I can\t take the qualifying examination in India. How do I even fill out my application if I don\t have a degree? Mr Kumar laments. Its a reality that 22-year old medical student Swati Sagarika Sabat is still coming to terms with. Shes back home in Kendrapara city in the eastern state of Odisha struggling to learn medicine over a Zoom class her university in Ukraine has organised. We are not sitting with our teachers or seeing patients. How can anyone learn how to perform a surgery online? We can\t learn without getting any practical experience says Ms Sabat. Shortage of doctors Some feel the government should allow the students from Ukraine to be accommodated in local medical colleges. The government has said it is looking into their matter. But what is essential is improving the existing infrastructure in India so that students have more choices in the country instead of having to go abroad. In the last seven years the number of medical seats in Indian colleges has gone up from around 52000 to nearly 89000. This is a substantial rise but still not enough. With one doctor for every 1500 people India desperately need more medical professionals The government is looking to set up hospitals in districts especially in rural areas. The upgraded district hospitals will have medical colleges attached to them. By using district hospitals as a training area you are actually also creating a cultural shift. You are making them much more responsive to the needs of the community says Dr Reddy. You may also be interested in: Media caption Watch: Indian students on the trauma of escaping Ukraines war]

Ukraine conflict: What is Nato and how has it responded to Russia's invasion?,Nato faces one of the biggest challenges in its history with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.,Ukraine conflict: What is Nato and how has it responded to Russias invasion? Published 25 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Leaders of the Nato military alliance have approved major increases of forces in Eastern Europe. They also said that any use of chemical or biological weapons by Russia would result in severe consequences. What is Nato? Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - is a military alliance formed in 1949 by 12 countries including the US Canada the UK and France. Its aim was originally to counter the threat of post-war Russian expansion in Europe. Soviet Russia responded by creating its own military alliance of eastern European communist countries called the Warsaw Pact. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 a number of former Warsaw Pact countries switched sides and joined Nato. The alliance now has 30 members. Members agree to come to one anothers aid in the event of an armed attack against any individual member state. Why isnt Nato sending troops to Ukraine? Because Ukraine isnt a Nato member the alliance isnt obliged to come to the countrys defence. And Nato countries fear that if their troops confront Russian forces in Ukraine it could lead to an all-out conflict between Russia and the West. Nato says its members are determined to do all we can to support Ukraine but must ensure the war doesn\t escalate beyond its borders. This is why Nato rejected imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine. However it has approved sending four new battlegroups to Slovakia Hungary Bulgaria and Romania - three of which border Ukraine - doubling Natos presence in the region. Western leaders meet to discuss Ukraine support UK troops will not fight against Russia - Wallace Why isnt Ukraine a Nato member? Nato offered Ukraine a path towards membership in 2008. After Russias annexation of Crimea in 2014 Ukraine made joining a priority. But this hasnt happened mainly because of Russias long-standing opposition. One of Russias demands before the invasion was that Ukraine should never be allowed to join - something the alliance refused to support. Russia fears Nato is encroaching on its territory by taking on new members from eastern Europe and that admitting Ukraine would bring its forces into its backyard. Ukraine\s President Zelensky has accepted his country can\t join Nato at present saying: It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of Nato. We understand this. China joins Russia in opposing Nato expansion Which weapons have the UK and other countries sent to Ukraine? Ahead of the Nato meeting in Brussels the UK said it would provide 6000 new defensive missiles and £25m to help Ukraine pay its armed forces. The UK has already supplied more than 4000 shoulder-mounted NLAW anti-tank missiles as well as a small number of Javelin missiles. It has also sent some Starstreak missiles. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption A Ukrainian soldier holding a Javelin anti-tank missile system during exercises in 2021 It has also given body armour helmets and boots. In addition the UK has deployed Sky Sabre a long-range air defence system to Poland along with 100 military personnel to operate it. The US initially sent $200m (£152m) and then a further $350m (£267m) of weapons. This included Javelin missiles Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and body armour. The US has since announced a $1bn (£760m) security aid package. This includes more sophisticated longer-range weapons and drones. It has also allowed other Nato countries to supply Ukraine with US-made weapons. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Nato has stepped up its military defences in eastern Europe The EU has said it will spend up to 450m euros (£376m) to fund the supply of weapons to Ukraine. It is the first time in its history that the EU has helped provide arms for a warzone. Germany too has dropped its long-standing restrictions on supplying weapons to a combat area. The Netherlands Belgium Poland Estonia Latvia the Czech Republic and Slovakia have also sent military equipment including ammunition fuel and rations. Are arms shipments to Ukraine making a difference? How many troops does Nato have in Eastern Europe? Even before the latest deployments are agreed Nato already had troops stretching from the Baltic republics in the north to Romania in the south. They were stationed there in 2014 after Russia\s annexation of Crimea and are designed to act as a tripwire in case of a Russian attack. Nato has sent elements of its 40000-strong Response Force to Eastern European countries bordering Russia and Ukraine. It has 100 fighter jets on high alert and 120 ships including three carrier groups patrolling the seas from the far north to the eastern Mediterranean. The US has committed to sending more troops to Europe - they will join the four multinational battlegroups Nato has in Estonia Latvia Lithuania and Poland and its multinational brigade in Romania.]

"Ukraine not alone in fight against Russia, says Boris Johnson","Boris Johnson warns if Vladimir Putin uses chemical weapons in Ukraine the consequences will be ""catastrophic for him"".",Ukraine not alone in fight against Russia says Boris Johnson Published 25 March comments Comments Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EPA Ukraine is not alone in its fight against Russia\s invasion Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He said the UK would not stand by while Vladimir Putin vents his fury on Ukraine and would work to ramp up defensive weaponry for the country. Speaking in Brussels he warned that if the Russian president used chemical weapons the consequences would be catastrophic for him. Earlier the UK announced sanctions on 65 more Russian groups and individuals. Mr Johnson later told BBC Newsnight that Russia did not want peace and instead wanted to intensify its attack on Ukraine. Leaders from Nato the EU and the G7 have been holding emergency meetings in Brussels to discuss the conflict. Speaking at a news conference following the Nato summit Mr Johnson defended the level of the UKs support for Ukraine saying the government planned to send 6000 more missiles to the country as well as an extra £25m in aid to help Ukraine pay the salaries of its armed forces. The PM said kit would be provided to Ukraine to defend against its bullying neighbour. Mr Johnson also promised a new deployment of UK troops to Bulgaria on top of doubling troops both in Poland and in Estonia. It follows Natos earlier announcement that new battle groups would be created in Bulgaria Hungary Romania and Slovakia. The message Putin can take is: Ukraine is not alone. We stand with the people of Kyiv Mariupol Lviv and Donetsk Mr Johnson said. As President Zelensky himself has said the people of Ukraine must prevail and Putin must fail - and he will. Lets hit Putins gold says PM amid new sanctions Defiant troops to Russians: Go home while youre alive Western leaders meet to discuss Ukraine support Mr Johnson added that Western nations were looking to steadily ratchet up the amount of military gear they are sending Ukraine but that it was proving difficult to meet the country\s request for warplanes and tanks. In a virtual appearance at the summit earlier Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\s asked Nato for 1% of all your planes 1% of all your tanks. Mr Johnson said: What President Zelensky wants is to try to relieve Mariupol and to help the thousands of Ukrainian fighters in the city. To that end he does need armour as he sees it. We are looking at what we can do to help. But logistically it looks very difficult both with armour and with jets. Mr Johnson added that no Western power was looking to put boots on the ground or impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. He acknowledged that the Ukrainian president wanted more from Nato saying allies felt agony about their inability to do more given the constraints we face. In a statement reported by Russias Ria news agency Russias foreign ministry said Natos decision to continue supporting Ukraine showed the military alliance wanted the conflict to continue. Media caption Watch: Zelensky calls on people to support freedom one month after Russia invaded Ukraine The UK government has already given £400m in humanitarian and economic aid to Ukraine and its neighbouring nations since Russias invasion last month. The PM said ministers had sanctioned more than 1000 Russian individuals and entities so far in the toughest sanctions the UK had ever imposed. The Wagner Group a private military firm thought to function as an arms-length unit of the Russian military was among the 65 entities hit by the latest sanctions announced by the UK earlier. Also targeted were Gazprombank the countrys third-largest bank and one of the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas and the state-run shipping firm Sovcomflot. The stepdaughter of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov Polina Kovaleva who is thought to own a London property worth an estimated £4m was also targeted by the measures. Earlier Mr Johnson called on the West to consider measures to prevent Russia using its gold reserves to prop up its currency the rouble. He told the news conference the Kremlin was trying to get around the sanctions on their gold and the UK and others were trying to ensure there was no leakage or no sale of bullion into markets around the world. War in Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby WATCH: Destruction of Ukraines cities from above ZELENSKY: How Ukraines leader tailors his addresses READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis The prime minister said he was not remotely anti-Russian after the Kremlin labelled him the most active participant in the race to be anti-Russian. He said that while one could be sympathetic to ordinary Russians the way Mr Putin was leading Russia was utterly catastrophic and his invasion of Ukraine was inhuman and barbaric. Mr Johnson dismissed talk about the use of nuclear weapons as a distraction from what was happening in Ukraine - where he said Russia\s use of conventional weapons against innocent people had been absolutely barbaric. He warned that any use of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine by Russia would be disastrous for Putin. There is a visceral horror of the use of these weapons of mass destruction. I think that if Putin were to engage in anything like that the consequences would be very very severe. You have to have a bit of ambiguity about your response but I think it would be catastrophic for him if he were to do that. And I think that he understands that. Media caption Watch what Boris Johnson says about the prospect of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine In an interview with the BBCs Newsnight Mr Johnson said Ukraine can win the war with Russia - not necessarily on the battlefield but by making an occupation impossible. There\s a sense in which Putin has already failed or lost because I think that he had literally no idea that the Ukrainians were going to mount the resistance that they are and he totally misunderstood what Ukraine is - and far from extinguishing Ukraine as a nation he\s solidified it... He can\t subjugate Ukraine. The prime minister added that he was not optimistic the Russian president truly wanted peace and that he had instead decided to double down in his assault on Ukraine which he said was a tragic mistake. Mr Johnson sparked anger at the weekend after appearing to make a comparison between Britons voting to leave the European Union and Ukrainians fighting for the freedom from Russia. But when asked about this the prime minister said that had not been the analogy he was making and his words had been wildly misconstrued. Elsewhere US President Joe Biden warned any use of chemical weapons by Mr Putin would be met with a response in kind the nature of which would depend on the nature of the use. Mr Biden said the Russian President had miscalculated in his decision to invade Ukraine and had banked on Nato being split. Nato has never never been more united. Putin is getting exactly the opposite of (what) he intended to have as a consequence of going into Ukraine.

Steve Bullock 61 from Middlesbrough last saw his wife Lyuda when he left her in eastern Ukraine on 18 February. He had planned to return weeks later but then Russia invaded. He said his wife 53 is staying in her home town of Zasullya where she continues to teach English in between making camouflage netting to cover vehicles wanting to drive out. The couple met online five years ago and got married in September 2020. Neither has been able to stay too long in each others home countries due to visa requirements and plans for a permanent visa application for his wife were delayed due to her work. Mr Bullock said none of the couples friends and family in Ukraine thought Russia would invade the country and he had his return to Ukraine booked for March. If the war had started when I was there there is no way I would have left he said. IMAGE SOURCE STEVE BULLOCK Image caption Steve Bollcuk said he would have stayed in Ukraine with his wife if he knew war was coming He said his wife\s online lessons were frequently interrupted by air raid sirens and rocket fire can heard at night although her village remains relatively safe. Mr Bullock has sent money for things like petrol pharmacy supplies and baby milk but said he quickly came to realise thousands of pounds were going to be needed to support people. An online donation page has already brought in 90% of the £2000 he initially set out to raise. He said the generosity of people in the UK who are sending supplies to the Ukrainian border is tremendous. Mr Bullock said he video calls his wife up to four times a day but it\s hard to see what she and her fellow Ukrainians are going through. Sometimes she wants to get out and other times she says \everything will be okay don\t worry\ Mr Bullock said. He said: If she said \get me out of here\ I would drive to the Ukrainian border wherever she was at the drop of a hat. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter Facebook and Instagram.

"Ukraine: No Russia regime change plans, says Blinken",The US secretary of state spoke after President Biden said Vladimir Putin should not remain in power.,Ukraine: No Russia regime change plans says Blinken Published 7 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Antony Blinken said it was up to the Russian people to choose their leader US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has denied that the United States has any plans to bring about regime change in Russia or anywhere else. Mr Blinkens comments come a day after President Joe Biden said his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin should not be allowed to remain in power. Mr Biden made the unscripted remark at the end of a speech in Poland. Mr Blinken said the president simply made the point that Mr Putin could not be allowed to wage war against Ukraine. The Kremlin dismissed Mr Bidens remark saying it was for Russians to choose their leader. I think the president the White House made the point last night that quite simply President Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else Mr Blinken said on Sunday during a visit to Israel. As you know and as you have heard us say repeatedly we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia or anywhere else for that matter. In this case as in any case it\s up to the people of the country in question it\s up to the Russian people he added. Media caption Watch: Joe Biden closes speech in Poland by saying Vladimir Putin cannot remain in power For God\s sake this man cannot remain in power US President Joe Biden said about his Russian counterpart President Vladimir Putin during a speech in Poland\s capital Warsaw on Saturday. This was quickly followed by the White House saying Mr Biden wasnt calling for regime change but was instead making a point about Mr Putin not being allowed to exercise power over his neighbours. This was clearly an attempt at rolling back - the concern is that this is going to put more pressure on Putin and make him more uneasy. Given that he is the head of a country that is struggling militarily and is in control of a nuclear arsenal the concern on the Americans part is that they dont want to back Mr Putin into a corner. Calling out for regime change directly could cause instability and increase unpredictability. And the last thing you want in these circumstances is unpredictability. Mr Bidens comment prompted strong criticism from veteran US diplomat Richard Haass. The comments made a difficult situation more difficult and a dangerous situation more dangerous tweeted Mr Haass who is president of the US Council on Foreign Relations. That is obvious he added. Less obvious is how to undo the damage but I suggest his chief aides reach their counterparts & make clear the US is prepared to deal with this Russian government. Mr Haass returned to the subject after the White House qualified President Biden\s remarks saying: The White House walk back of @POTUS regime change call is unlikely to wash. Putin will see it as confirmation of what he\s believed all along. Bad lapse in discipline that runs risk of extending the scope and duration of the war.

Ukraine: India 'feeling the heat' over neutrality,"Joe Biden says India has been ""somewhat shaky"" in its response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine.",Ukraine: India feeling the heat over neutrality Soutik Biswas India correspondent Published 25 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption India has doggedly pursued a foreign policy based on non-alignment On Monday US President Joe Biden told a meeting of business leaders in Washington that among the so-called Quad group of nations India was being somewhat shaky in its response to Vladimir Putin\s invasion of Ukraine. The US Japan and Australia - the three other members of this coalition formed to counter China\s influence - have been extremely strong in terms of dealing with Putin\s aggression he said. India however has doggedly pursued a non-aligned foreign policy since independence where according to the first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru we will stay away from the big blocs…to be friendly to all countries…not join any alliance. But will the war in Ukraine now put Indias fabled neutrality under strain? Uncharted territory India is feeling the heat no doubt about it Michael Kugelman deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center a Washington-based think tank says. Fence-sitting is a bigger diplomatic gamble now than in the past given that Russia\s invasion of Ukraine is one of the worst aggressions in decades and India\s relations with the West have never been stronger. India has abstained from voting in the United Nations - three times in a week - on resolutions condemning Russia. There have been reports of a surge of Indian imports of discounted Russian oil as energy prices spiked in the wake of the war. And it has pointedly stopped short of criticising Russia which it has called a longstanding and time-tested friend in the past. The two countries share a decades-old relationship harking back to the Cold War and Russia is also Indias biggest defence supplier. The US is now trying to persuade India that things have changed. For one the relationship between the two countries has deepened - bilateral trade between India and the US is $150bn compared to $8bn between India and Russia. US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland visited Delhi this week and had in her own words broad and deep conversations with Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and senior officials. She acknowledged the historical relationship between India and Russia but said times have changed now and there was an evolution of thinking in India. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption PM Modi with President Putin in 2021 - India and Russia have a historical relationship Ms Nuland told journalists that the US and Europe were willing to be strong defence and security partners of India. She said US could help wean India off its dependence on Russian defence supplies. The war was a major inflection point in the autocratic-democratic struggle in which India\s support was needed she noted. Such an explicit message from the US Mr Kugelman says may well be uncharted territory. But Indian experts are loathe to believe that the country is under diplomatic pressure. Why India is not criticising Russia over Ukraine They point to the fact that other Quad members have been sympathetic to India and that the US itself had acknowledged India\s humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. If there\s one country which is isolated in the Quad it\s not India it\s the US says former Indian diplomat Jitendra Nath Misra. And weakening a strategic partner through sanctions - for buying Russian arms or oil - doesnt benefit the US which wants India to play counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific. Strategically neutral At the same time Indias close ties with Russia do not mean that it has been aloof to the crisis in Ukraine experts say. They point to the joint statement issued last week by Mr Modi and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida during the latter\s visit to Delhi: the two leaders expressed their serious concern about the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. They also emphasised that the contemporary global order has been built on the UN Charter international law and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of states. Mr Modi has spoken to both President Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urging them to end the violence. His government managed to get more than 22000 Indians out of Ukraine in 90 evacuation flights. IMAGE SOURCE AFP Image caption Russia is supplying equipment like the S-400 missile defence system to India Former diplomat Anil Triguniyat who served in Moscow says President Biden\s remark that India\s response was shaky was possibly a joke of some kind. India\s position has been consistent and principled all through. India has stood for diplomacy dialogue respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine he says. We have to be strategically neutral. There\s no other way. Happymon Jacob a professor of foreign policy at Delhi\s Jawaharlal Nehru University believes that the heat hasn\t really increased on India and it is managing the contradictions quite well. The question is whether India could have done more he says. Can India do more? The jury is out on this. Although India had managed the crisis admirably it should have called a spade a spade… It is an invasion it is a war India\s former foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon told The Wire. It affects your credibility if you don\t he added. But Delhi\s special relationship with Moscow - fraught with nostalgia and deep trust as Mr Kugelman describes it - means that it won\t easily turn against its ally. These sentiments die hard even after Russia has launched a massive cold-blooded invasion. But at the same time India doesn\t want to alienate its ties with the West. One way to avoid alienation say experts is for India to offer itself as a third-party mediator - something which Ukraines Ambassador to India Igor Polikha had urged at the beginning of the war. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption India has provided humanitarian aid - medicines medical equipment relief material - to Ukraine India can leverage its deep ties to Moscow and cordial relations with Kyiv and try to push both sides to de-escalate Mr Kugelman says. To be sure Putin might be undeterrable. But if Delhi is at least making an effort to bring about de-escalation that should pre-empt potential tensions with the West over India\s refusal to take the West\s side. Mr Jacob echoes the sentiment saying when Ukrainians asked for mediation India could have taken up the offer. India still has the opportunity. It should still go ahead and offer itself as a neutral mediator. After all India needs both US and Russia on its side to help manage its fraught relationship with China. Last year the two neighbours faced off against each other along their disputed border in the Himalayan region. In the long term Mr Triguniyat says India should pursue a policy of strategic autonomy - not far removed from non-alignment -and initiate a grouping of nations for strategic unity to serve their development interests in a much more severe Cold War 2.0 that is likely to emerge after the war in Ukraine. Former Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran has said the nightmare scenario for India would be if the US comes to the conclusion that it confronts a greater threat from Russia and that this justifies a strategic accommodation with China. Bluntly this means concede Chinese dominance in Asia while safeguarding its European flank. That\s a nightmare India will never get used to.

Cardiff Half Marathon 2022: Latest updates Half marathon postponement tough for charities I managed to convince my mum to leave the city but my grandmother refuses to leave even though the Russians have bombed Kharkiv almost out of existence. She lost half her flat in a raid. It was heart-breaking to hear my mum full of fear and uncertainty while I am safe. My grandmother tells me how scared she is to possibly lose her life in such an unfair way. Many of my friends are spending days underground in basements simply trying to stay alive. I\m lucky to be where I am and felt I had to try to do something anything to help raise money and awareness. Image caption Inna Gordiienko pictured after completing the race on Sunday Before Sunday\s race she said: I\ll be running the race for my country my home and my loved ones. I will be thinking about my mum and grandmother every step of the way.

She survived the accident which killed her friend Savannah but was knocked unconscious and woke up unable to walk after breaking both her legs. After months of intense rehabilitation she was told she would probably never be able to run again. Five years on and she was running in her friends memory. I don\t like being told I can\t do something she said. I was told… \don\t think about it - you\re going to have arthritic knees - just don\t go down it. It won\t be good for you\. I went to a physio myself and said \Do you think I can?\ - and she said \why not?\. Because I was serious about it I thought I\m going to do this.

Mentally - getting rid of the \I can\t walk I can\t run\ - that\s been the hardest thing for me she said. That\s far bigger than the physical. That for me was the hardest thing. I\d been in this accident. My legs didn\t work like they should. Even to stand up for the first time I felt so heavy. My legs had no weight through them for months. So much of it is mental. You\ve just got to learn to trust your body and so going from nothing to walking was hard enough. Getting into the running was just trial and error. Putting one foot in front of the other and we\ll see what happens.

Her life finished at 26 and I think about all these things that I want to do with my life - and I can she said. I know she\d be thinking I was crazy. But too many people in society don\t push boundaries. They don\t push outside their comfort zone. I think life is actually outside your comfort zone.

War in Ukraine: UK unveils new Russia sanctions as PM aims at gold reserves,The UK reveals more sanctions as Boris Johnson and other Nato leaders meet to discuss the war in Ukraine.,War in Ukraine: UK unveils new Russia sanctions as PM aims at gold reserves By Christy Cooney BBC News Published 24 March comments Comments Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS The West should consider ways to stop Russia using its gold reserves to prop up the rouble the prime minister said. Boris Johnsons comments came as the UK announced sanctions on 65 more groups and individuals including a private military firm and a major Russian bank. Speaking ahead of a Nato summit the PM said the UK and the West must tighten the economic vice on Vladimir Putin. He said Russia crossed red lines by targeting Ukrainian civilians and tough steps now could help shorten the war. In addition to the new raft of financial sanctions the UK government has announced plans to send 6000 more missiles to Ukraine. Leaders from Nato the EU and the G7 are holding emergency meetings in Brussels to discuss the ongoing situation in Ukraine. On Thursday Nato announced the creation of new battle groups in Bulgaria Hungary Romania and Slovakia while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky used a virtual address to urge the bloc to increase its supply of military equipment. Ahead of the talks Mr Johnson said that by deliberately bombing civilian centres Putin had already crossed the red line into barbarism. We\ve got to step up. We\ve got to increase our support he said. We\ve got to tighten the economic vice around Putin sanctioning more people today as we are sanctioning the Wagner Group looking at what we can do to stop Putin using his gold reserves. In an interview with LBC he added: We need to do more economically. Can we do more to stop him Putin] using his gold reserves for instance in addition to his cash reserves? The more pressure we apply now particularly on things like gold I believe the more we can shorten the war … And then we need to do more to give the Ukrainians military support. As Mr Putin invaded Ukraine the Russian Central Bank deployed some of its $640bn war chest of currency and gold reserves to prop up the Russian rouble.

Also targeted were Gazprombank the countrys third-largest bank and one of the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas and the state-run shipping firm Sovcomflot. The reported step-daughter of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov Polina Kovaleva who is thought to own a London property worth an estimated £4million was also targeted by the measures. Western leaders meet to discuss Ukraine support Zelensky calls on people to protest to support freedom In his speech to Nato leaders Mr Zelensky called on them to give or sell Ukraine more tanks and anti-aircraft defence systems. I don\t want to blame Nato. I understand this is not you he said. These are not your missiles or bombs which are destroying our cities. I simply want you to know the alliance still can prevent Ukrainian deaths… by providing us all the munitions we are asking for. The summit follows an announcement by the UK government that it would be providing Ukraine with an additional 6000 anti-tank and other missiles. The UK has already sent 4000 anti-tank weapons but will now send another 3000 plus a similar number of what Downing Street described as high explosive missiles. The prime minister is also expected to set out plans to offer more help to Ukraine with intelligence and longer-range combat. Ukrainian officials indicated this week the countrys armed forces had the equipment they needed to stop tanks at short range but needed more that would help them do the same over longer distances. The UK will also send an additional £25m in aid to help Ukraine pay the salaries of its armed forces. The government has already given £400m in humanitarian and economic aid to Ukraine and neighbouring nations since Russias invasion.

Ukraine war: Liz Truss says Russia sanctions should end only after withdrawal,"Russia must commit to no further aggression or face them being reimposed, the foreign secretary says.",Ukraine war: Liz Truss says Russia sanctions should end only after withdrawal Published 7 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EPA Sanctions on Russia are a hard lever that should only be removed following a full ceasefire and withdrawal from Ukraine the foreign secretary says. Liz Truss told the Sunday Telegraph that Moscow would also have to commit to no further aggression or face the prospect of them being reimposed. The West had to remain tough to get peace she said. The UK US and EU have so far imposed sanctions on over 1000 Russian individuals and businesses. This week saw Moscow announce it would be refocusing its military operations in Ukraine to the countrys east. The move was interpreted by many as a sign that the Kremlin was looking to scale back an invasion that has so far made significantly less progress than was widely expected. Ms Truss said that a negotiations unit had been set up to assist Ukraine once the Russians were serious about negotiations but added: I don\t believe they are serious at present. That\s why... we need to double down on sanctions she said. The foreign secretary has previously said she believes the peace talks are a smokescreen designed to distract from Russia\s actions and allow its armed forces time to regroup.

READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis It comes after the government announced it had detained indefinitely two jets owned by Russian oligarch Eugene Shvidler who had been sanctioned over his ties with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. The jets estimated to be worth $60m (£45m) were seized at Farnborough and Biggin Hill airports following a three-week investigation. Ms Truss said she believed more should have been done to deter Mr Putin following his annexation of Crimea in 2014. So there needs to be hard levers she said. Of course sanctions are a hard lever. Those sanctions should only come off with a full ceasefire and withdrawal but also commitments that there will be no further aggression. She added that snapback sanctions could be used in the event of more aggression in the future. IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption Eugene Shvidler (right) has been sanctioned over his ties with longstanding business partner Roman Abramovich As well as sanctions on individuals recent weeks have seen dozens of countries impose bans on the export of luxury goods to Russia and close their airspace to Russian airlines. Some Russian banks have also been banned from using Swift the system used to manage international payments and efforts are underway to explore how Europe can reduce its dependency on Russian oil and gas. Ms Truss\s comments echo those of US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken who said this month that the sanctions on Russia were not designed to be permanent. Mr Blinken said the sanctions could go away in the event of an irreversible withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. However speaking in Poland on Saturday President Biden said that while sanctions were weakening Russia the West needed to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead. Asked about ongoing disagreements with the EU about the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol which sets out the post-Brexit trading arrangements between Northern Ireland and the EU Ms Truss said that countries would always have differences that we need to resolve. But those types of differences between friends and allies are different from the scale and the sheer belligerence and aggression and lying of Russia she said. She added that given the scale of their differences with Russia it was vital that Western countries stick together.

Ukraine daily round-up: Biden meets Ukrainian ministers,The talks came as Russia faced more counter-attacks and another of its generals was reported killed.,Ukraine daily round-up: Biden meets Ukrainian ministers Published 26 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS US President Joe Biden has held his first face-to-face talks with Ukrainian government ministers since their country was invaded by Russia. In Warsaw he met Ukraines defence and foreign ministers Oleksii Reznikov and Dmytro Kuleba. Some say the fact the ministers left Ukraine for the talks is a sign of growing confidence in how the war with Russia is going. Mr Kuleba said they had received additional pledges from the US president on developing defence co-operation. Mr Biden said stability in Europe was critically important to US interests and that whenever Washington had stayed out of crises in Europe it had come back to bite the country. But the US president also made some fiery comments on Saturday. Meeting Ukrainian refugees in Poland Mr Biden called the Russian president a butcher - something unlikely to help strained US-Russia relations. Then later in a speech in front of Warsaw\s historic royal castle he addressed the Russian people telling them: For God\s sake this man cannot remain in power. That led to a stern message from the Kremlin that the president of Russia is elected by Russians - and not the US president. Separately a White House spokesperson told the media that Mr Biden was not calling for regime change with the remark - merely making a point about Mr Putin\s attempt to exercise power over other countries. In Ukraine itself officials said three powerful explosions had rocked the western city of Lviv. Thick black smoke was seen rising over the outskirts of the city. The cause of the blasts is not known but city officials warned residents to remain indoors. Saboteurs or spectres? Image caption Bohdan had to make a police statement after a neighbour reported his fairy lights Since the war began there have been rumours of Russian saboteurs among the Ukrainian population - malicious agents acting from within. But how much of it is real?

He was the commander of Russias 49th combined army. A western official said he was the seventh general to die in Ukraine and the second lieutenant general - the highest rank officer reportedly killed. It is thought that low morale among Russian troops has forced senior officers closer to the front line. Ukrainian media reported on Friday that the general was killed at the Chornobaivka airbase near Kherson which Russia is using as a command post and has been attacked by Ukraines military several times. Another lieutenant general Andrei Mordvichev was reportedly killed by a Ukrainian strike on the same base last week. Read the full report by Ben Tobias here.

Ukraine war: Chernobyl’s vodka producer remains defiant,"A company that produces Chernobyl’s ‘Atomik vodka’ releases new products, donating profits to Ukraine's refugees.",Ukraine war: Chernobyl’s vodka producer remains defiant By Victoria Gill Science correspondent BBC News Published 7 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE ATOMIK Image caption There are now three varieties of Atomik Chernobyl fruit spirit It started with Chernobyl moonshine. Scientists who were studying crops grown in the Chernobyl exclusion zone decided to use some of their leftover grain to produce alcohol. That experiment became a social enterprise that made and sold a spirit drink called appropriately enough Atomik. The aim was to show that slightly radioactive fruit grown in orchards in or near the contaminated exclusion zone that surrounds Chernobyls nuclear power plant could be distilled into a spirit that was no more radioactive than any other. Profits were channelled into communities that live in deprived areas close to the zone. Now as Russian troops occupy the land where that fruit is grown and harvested this unusual company is making a defiant marketing move by releasing two more premium drinks and donating profits to help Ukraine\s refugees. Image caption The land around the nuclear power plant abandoned since the 1986 accident is now occupied by Russian forces While the future of an enterprise that makes a niche spirit might seem insignificant amid the ongoing crisis in Ukraine it is an example of how decades of progress has been upended by war. Why there was a radiation spike at Chernobyl Chernobyl vodka made in exclusion zone After 30 years of studying the exclusion zone the scientists who set up the Atomik project enabled people on contaminated land to sell their own produce. It was a small but significant milestone in the recovery of a patch of Ukraine that was largely abandoned after the nuclear catastrophe in 1986. Now that whole region where we harvest our fruit for production is occupied by Russian forces explained Kyrylo Korychenskyi an environmental researcher and member of the Atomik team. Russian forces seized control of the now defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the first few days of the invasion. Image caption The damaged reactor is entombed by a steel confinement structure Military machinery kicking up radioactive dust in the usually carefully controlled zone caused a spike in radiation levels. The information we\re getting from the region is very bad says Kyrylo. Russian forces go into the villages and put their tanks in the middle of people\s gardens. In the heart of the exclusion zone Ukrainian authorities have accused Russian forces of looting and destroying a new research laboratory designed to process and analyse radioactive samples and to monitor the zone. Prof Jim Smith is one of the founders of Atomik and a scientist at the University of Portsmouth. He has spent much of his career studying the exclusion zone and says that decades of progress are now being destroyed. IMAGE SOURCE ATOMIK Image caption Kyrylo Korychenskyi at the distillery before the war in Ukraine The communities who have been suffering for 35 years are now suffering even more he told BBC News. We used to worry about the risk from radioactive strontium in cities] that are now being bombed. The future of the Atomik project - and that of the people who live and grow fruit in their orchards near the exclusion zone - is uncertain. If the war has ended by the time the next harvest season comes around Kyrylo - who remains in his home in Kyiv with his wife and children - says he hopes to keep going. He hopes to go back to his pre-war life and pick up the project where he left off. I think people there will need money and help because the Chernobyl accident for this territory will no longer be the worst thing that happened there. Follow Victoria on Twitter]

They are holding an emergency summit on the same day that leaders of Nato and the EU also meet in Brussels. Ukraine\s President Volodymyr Zelensky says the trio of meetings will show who is our friend who is our partner and who sold us out and betrayed us. Western leaders meet to discuss Ukraine support What is the G7? The G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world\s seven largest so-called advanced economies which dominate global trade and the international financial system. They are Canada France Germany Italy Japan the UK and the United States. Russia joined in 1998 creating the G8 but was excluded in 2014 for its takeover of Crimea. China has never been a member despite its large economy and having the worlds biggest population. Its relatively low level of wealth per person means its not seen as an advanced economy in the way the G7 members are. Throughout the year G7 ministers and officials hold meetings form agreements and publish joint statements on global events. Germany took over the G7 presidency in January 2022 which means it will host the organisations annual summit in June. The EU is not a member of the G7 but attends the annual summit. What is the G7 doing about Ukraine? Between them the G7 nations have already imposed on Russia the biggest package of sanctions ever imposed on a large economy. They have blocked the country from international commerce and the global financial system and they have frozen the assets of its wealthiest individuals. G7 countries who are members of the Nato security alliance have also provided Ukraine with weapons and other military equipment. What is Nato and how is it helping Ukraine? IMAGE SOURCE NUR VIA GETTY IMAGES Image caption Volodymyr Zelensky says the G7 meeting will show who is our friend ... and who sold us out and betrayed us. What else could G7 countries do? The question is whether G7 leaders are prepared to take harsher steps against Russia which would also hurt their own economies. One key issue is whether to restrict completely the import of Russian oil and gas. The US is banning all Russian oil and gas imports and the UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Ukraines leaders are keen for other G7 nations to follow suit. However European nations get a quarter of their oil and 40% of their gas from Russia and so far the EU has only agreed to reduce its Russian gas imports by two-thirds. Germany has already suspended progress of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. It is designed to take gas from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to Lubmin in Germany under the Baltic Sea. IMAGE SOURCE AFP Image caption Nord Stream 2 would have doubled gas exports to Germany But in a tweet the Ukrainian foreign ministry urged member states to go further calling on leaders to stop financing the war stop paying for Russian energy. One suggested solution is for European nations to strike a deal with the US to import more of its liquefied natural gas. The G7 summit could provide an opportunity to discuss this option. Does the G7 have any power? It cant pass any laws because it is made up of separate nations with their own democratic processes. However some of its past decisions have had global effects. For example the G7 played crucial role in setting up a global fund to fight malaria and Aids in 2002. Ahead of the 2021 G7 summit in the UK the G7 finance ministers agreed to make multinational companies pay more tax. It has also provided financial aid to developing countries and addressed climate change. Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Economics Diplomacy Ukraine G7]

Ukraine: Sadiq Khan says UK should do more to help refugees,"The London mayor calls the actions of the government ""embarrassing"" compared with other countries.",Ukraine: Sadiq Khan says UK should do more to help refugees Published 26 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE AARON CHOWN/PA WIRE Image caption Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the actions of the UK government were embarrassing compared to other countries The UK should be doing much more to help Ukrainian refugees London mayor Sadiq Khan has said. Mr Khan joined a large crowd that gathered near Hyde Park ahead of a march in solidarity with the war-torn country. The Labour mayor said the actions of the UK government compared with other European countries were embarrassing. Mr Khan said it needed to be made much more easier for those who are fleeing Ukraine to come here. Earlier this month the government opened it Homes for Ukraine scheme which allows UK nationals to individually sponsor a Ukrainian nationals visa so that those without family connections can still come to live with a host family in the UK. Image caption The crowd carried flags and banners as they marched through London Protesters made their way towards Trafalgar Square whilst holding Ukrainian flags and banners that said stop Putin\s war no fly zone and solidarity with Ukraine. The crowd chanted we stand with Ukraine as traffic behind was brought to a standstill. About 10 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine because of the Russian invasion the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said. As well as the 3.6 million who have left for neighbouring countries another estimated 6.5 million people are thought to be displaced inside the war-torn country itself. At the scene By Chi Chi Izundu BBC News A group of children clutching balloons in the colours of the Ukrainian flag marched in the heat of the sun in central London leading todays protest. Joined by thousands of others mini flags were being handed out for people to show their solidarity. A sea of blue and yellow surrounded Nelsons column as special guests addressed the crowd trying to teach Ukrainian phrases. Most of the people that we stopped to speak to were either Ukrainian born or had Ukrainian links like Olaksana. She told us that her family had just fled Kharkiv and were in Hungary and Germany. She said: It is really hard to be in another country when your country is suffering. The least I can do is come to this protest and the least I can do is stand with Ukraine and unite as a nation and show the world they\re not going to kill us as a nation.

I\m full of admiration for anybody who has the space to provide a room for those who have fled Ukraine he said.

Western leaders meet to discuss Ukraine support,"President Joe Biden joins leaders of Nato, the EU and G7 in response to the invasion of Ukraine.",Western leaders meet to discuss Ukraine support By Jessica Parker in Brussels & Jonathan Beale in Norway BBC News Published 24 March comments Comments Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption President Biden is expected to discuss natural gas supplies as the EU moves to reduce exposure to Russia US President Joe Biden joins fellow Western leaders in Brussels on Thursday for three summits on Russias war in Ukraine a month after the invasion began. Nato the G7 and the EU are all holding meetings in a display of unity rarely seen by the West. Mr Biden will take part in all three the first ever visit by a US president to an EU summit in Brussels. But his visit to Brussels is not just about symbolism. Russias invasion of Ukraine has given the Western defensive alliance Nato a renewed sense of purpose. And as the EU attempts to sever energy ties with Russia it needs to forge and reinforce other relationships particularly with the US. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was due to appear by video link at all three summits. Natos 30 presidents and prime ministers will agree greater support for Ukraine and new troop deployments for Eastern allies. Their aim is to show solidarity to Kyiv though only up to a point. Many but not all have been willing to supply weapons. The UK said it would use both the G7 and Nato meetings to substantively increase defensive lethal aid to Ukraine. But the alliance has also made clear it wont become more directly involved and Mr Zelenskys repeated requests for a no-fly zone over Ukraine have pretty much been ignored. Nor is it clear how Nato would respond if Russia were to dramatically escalate the conflict in Ukraine - such as an attack on a Western weapons convoy the use of chemical or even tactical nuclear weapons. Natos red lines have so far been drawn at its borders. Why cant Ukraine join Nato? Collective defence For the past few weeks 30000 Nato troops from 25 countries have been training in Norway as part of Exercise Cold Response a long-planned exercise that has now taken on more significance. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Soldiers from Sweden which is not part of Nato joined thousands of troops on exercise in Norway Like Ukraine Norway borders Russia. The key difference is that as a Nato member Norway is covered by a commitment to collective defence - an attack on one is an attack on all. I think an exercise like this is pretty good to have to prove to countries like Russia… that you don\t want to mess with Nato a young Norwegian conscript called Peder told the BBC. Nato leaders are focused on how to boost their own defences. Theyve already sent thousands more troops to the alliances eastern flank along with more air defence batteries warships and aircraft. Five challenges for Biden in Europe Nato to send more troops to Eastern Europe This says Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is the new normal following Russia\s invasion of Ukraine. Russia will get exactly what it didn\t want - more not less Nato near its border. Nato battlegroups will stretch all the way from the Baltic to the Black Sea for the foreseeable future. Two EU countries that are not members of Nato - Sweden and Finland - contributed troops to the exercise in Norway. They appear to be edging closer and closer to Nato in the wake of Russias invasion. President Trump once questioned the very existence of Nato and French President Emmanuel Macron once called it brain dead. But President Biden\s visit to Brussels is proof that he sees it as being more important than ever to curb a more aggressive Russia. Dizzying EU unity Defence strategy will also play a part in an EU summit where leaders will approve plans that aim to pull member states closer together on military planning intelligence and procurement. One ambition is to have a rapidly deployable force of 5000 troops. It\s all part of the theme of strategic autonomy championed by Mr Macron. The argument is that a more sovereign Europe is a safer Europe whether thats by securing reliable supplies of energy and semiconductor chips or by boosting military spending. But the trickiest subject for the European Unions 27 member states is fast becoming the future of energy supplies as they try to look beyond Russia. After an initial dizzying display of unity on sanctions across all 27 member states there are now obvious ruptures over what to do next. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption EU leaders have reacted fast to Russias invasion with a series of hard-hitting sanctions German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has publicly denounced the idea of banning Russian gas and oil imports arguing it will drag Europe into a recession. Sanctions must not hit the European states harder than the Russian leadership. That is our principle he said on the eve of the summit. Blood money Soaring energy prices are also a concern to be discussed by EU leaders on Friday. But there are nations agitating for action as they voice deep discomfort about handing cash to the Kremlin via energy payments. It\s blood money said one central European diplomat. I don\t think some countries understand the gravity of the situation. President Bidens ability to offer Europe more US Liquefied Natural Gas is a key watch at Thursdays summit. The US is the worlds largest producer of natural gas. He is also expected to announce more sanctions on Russian political figures as well as so-called oligarchs. But the prospect of fresh EU sanctions this week is being played down. Some in Brussels call it fatigue while others insist it\s the right time to take stock.

What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion?,Western nations have imposed severe sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.,What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion? Published 24 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Measures designed to damage Russias economy have been introduced by countries opposed to its invasion of Ukraine. This has led to higher prices for Russian households and shortages of some goods. What are sanctions? Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another to stop it acting aggressively or breaking international law. They are among the toughest actions nations can take short of going to war. What sanctions have been imposed on Russia? Military goods and mercenaries A ban on the export of dual-use goods - items with both a civilian and military purpose such as vehicle parts - has been imposed by the UK EU and US. This is reportedly having an impact on some Russian manufacturers. Ukraine says Russias main armoured vehicle factory has run out of parts to make and repair tanks. It also says a tractor plant has stopped production because of a shortage of foreign-made parts. The UK is also imposing sanctions on Russias Wagner Group - a private military firm thought to function as an arms-length unit of the Russian military. Flights All Russian flights have been banned from US UK EU and Canadian airspace. The UK has also banned private jets chartered by Russians. Luxury goods The UK says it will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia - including vehicles high-end fashion and art. The EU has already imposed a ban. The UK will also put a 35% tax on some imports from Russia including vodka. Targeting individuals The US EU and UK have together sanctioned over 1000 Russian individuals and businesses including wealthy business leaders known as oligarchs who are considered close to the Kremlin. One high-profile oligarch sanctioned by the UK is Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich. IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption Roman Abramovich was attempting to sell Chelsea FC Assets belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov are also being frozen in the US EU UK and Canada. However many Russian oligarchs have put their properties and wealth under other names which means they may be beyond the reach of the UKs sanctions. The UK is also limiting the sale of golden visas which allowed wealthy Russians to get British residency rights. The hunt for superyachts of sanctioned Russians Oil and gas The US is banning all Russian oil and gas imports and the UK will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. The EU which gets a quarter of its oil and 40% of its gas from Russia says it will switch to alternative supplies and make Europe independent from Russian energy well before 2030. Germany has put on hold permission for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to open. Could the world survive without Russian oil and gas? Financial measures Western countries have frozen the assets of Russias central bank to stop it using its $630bn (£470bn) of foreign currency reserves. This has caused the value of the rouble to slump by 22% since the start of the year. That in turn has pushed up the price of imported goods and led to a 14% rise in Russias rate of inflation. Some Russian banks are being removed from the international financial messaging system Swift which is used to transfer money across borders. This will delay payments to Russia for energy exports. Other UK sanctions include: major Russian banks excluded from the UK financial system all Russian banks have had their assets frozen the Russian state and major companies are not be able to raise finance or borrow money in the UK a limit placed on deposits Russians can make at UK banks The EU also said it would target 70% of the Russian banking market and key state-owned firms. What are companies doing? A growing number of international companies including McDonalds Coca-Cola and Starbucks have suspended trading in Russia. After facing fierce criticism for continuing to operate in Russia Nestle has withdrawn some of its brands including KitKat and Nesquik but will still sell essential foods. However a number of other Western brands including Marks and Spencer Burger King and hotel groups Marriott and Accor say they cant pull out from Russia because their businesses there operate under complex franchise deals. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia How has Russia reacted to sanctions? Russia\s President Putin has said he will make unfriendly nations pay for their imports of Russian gas in roubles which would push up the value of the currency. Russia has banned exports of more than 200 products until the end of 2022 including telecoms medical vehicle agricultural electrical equipment and timber. In addition it is blocking interest payments to foreign investors who hold government bonds and banning Russian firms from paying overseas shareholders. It has stopped foreign investors who hold billions of dollars worth of Russian stocks and bonds from selling them. Could Russia turn to China as sanctions bite?

Russian general Yakov Rezantsev killed in Ukraine,Western officials believe low morale among Russian troops is forcing generals to the battlefield.,Russian general Yakov Rezantsev killed in Ukraine By Ben Tobias BBC News Published 26 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE DENIS NASIK/WIKIMEDIACOMMONS Image caption Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed in the Kherson region Ukraines defence ministry says another Russian general Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was killed in a strike near the southern city of Kherson. Rezantsev was the commander of Russias 49th combined army. A western official said he was the seventh general to die in Ukraine and the second lieutenant general - the highest rank officer reportedly killed. It is thought that low morale among Russian troops has forced senior officers closer to the front line. In a conversation intercepted by the Ukrainian military a Russian soldier complained that Rezantsev had claimed the war would be over within hours just four days after it began. Ukrainian media reported on Friday that the general was killed at the Chornobaivka airbase near Kherson which Russia is using as a command post and has been attacked by Ukraines military several times. Another lieutenant general Andrei Mordvichev was reportedly killed by a Ukrainian strike on the same base. Kherson was the first Ukrainian city to be occupied by Russian forces although there are reports that daily protests are held there against the Russian occupation. Although Russia has confirmed the death of only one general Kyiv and western officials believe up to seven have been killed in fighting since the war began. However the death of Maj Gen Magomed Tushayev of the Chechen national guard has been disputed. It is unusual for such senior Russian officers to be so close to the battlefield and western officials believe that they have been forced to move towards the front lines to deal with low morale among Russian troops. The unexpectedly strong Ukrainian resistance poor Russian equipment and a high death toll amongst Russian troops are all thought to be contributing to the low morale. Russian forces are believed to be relying in part on open communication systems for example mobile phones and analogue radios which are easy to intercept and could give away the locations of high-ranking officers. A person inside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskys inner circle told the Wall Street Journal that Ukraine had a military intelligence team dedicated to targeting Russias officer class. So far Vladimir Putin has only referred to the death of one general thought to be Maj Gen Andrey Sukhovetsky in a speech soon after the start of the war. Russia says 1351 soldiers have died since the war began in Ukraine although Kyiv and western officials say the number is much higher. Russias lost generals Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed by a Ukrainian strike on the Chornobaivka airbase near the city of Kherson. He was promoted to lieutenant general last year and was commander of the 49th combined army of Russias southern military district. He is said to have taken part in Russias military operation in Syria. Andrei Mordvichev was killed by a strike on the Chornobaivka airbase near Kherson according to Ukrainian officials. He was the commander of Russias 8th combined army of the southern military district. His death was reported on 18 March. Maj Gen Oleg Mityaev reportedly died somewhere near the city of Mariupol a city in south-east Ukraine which has seen some of the heaviest fighting so far. The nationalist Azov regiment claims to have killed him. He was a commander of the Russian armys 150th motorised rifle division a relatively new unit formed in 2016 and based in the Rostov region close to the Ukrainian border. Ukraine claims that the unit was created in order to take part in the conflict in separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine although Russia denies that its military was involved in fighting there. Maj Gen Andrei Kolesnikov of the 29th combined army was killed in fighting on 11 March according to official Ukrainian sources. The circumstances of his death were not given. After Kolesnikov became the third Russian general reportedly killed in Ukraine one western official told the Press Association that the Russian army may be suffering from low morale which is why high-ranking military officers are moving closer to the front line. Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov chief of staff of Russias 41st combined army was killed on 7 March outside the eastern city of Kharkiv according to Ukraines defence ministry. Kharkiv close to the Russian border has come under sustained attack from Russian forces. Ukraines military released a recording of what it said was two Russian security service officials discussing Gerasimovs death and complaining that their secure communication networks no longer worked in Ukraine. Gerasimov was involved in the second Chechen war the Russian military operation in Syria and in the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. Maj Gen Andrey Sukhovetsky a deputy commander at the same unit as Gerasimov was reportedly killed by a sniper on 3 March. Like Gerasimov Sukhovetsky was part of Russias military operations in Crimea and in Syria. Unlike the other generals Sukhovetskys death was reported in the Russian media and Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed in a speech that a general had died in Ukraine.

The two jets belonging to billionaire oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler had been under investigation at Farnborough and Biggin Hill airports for three weeks. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Russian President Vladimir] Putin\s friends should not enjoy luxuries while innocent people die in Ukraine. Mr Shvidler was sanctioned over ties with Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich. The government said Mr Shvidler a former boss and shareholder in Mr Abramovichs steel giant Evraz PLC was associated with a person benefitting from or supporting the Russian government. Luxury toys His net worth has been estimated at £1.2bn the government says while the seized jets are believed to be worth up to $60m (£45m). Mr Shapps said in a statement: Introducing these latest measures - detaining tens of millions of pounds worth of Russian private jets - shows this government will leave no stone unturned in depriving Putin\s cronies of their luxury toys. A private helicopter belonging to Russian firm HeliCo Group LLC has also been detained. Western nations opposed to the Russian presidents invasion of Ukraine have introduced a raft of sanctions designed to cripple Russias economy and hurt its wealthiest citizens. The UK has made it a criminal offence for planes owned operated or chartered by Russians - including private jets - to fly or land in the UK. Ukraine said it had inflicted powerful blows and significant losses on the Russians. But Russias army said the first phase of its military campaign in Ukraine is over and it will now focus on the eastern Donbas region.]

How charity speedrunning made gaming the new telethon Afghanistan War veteran who lost both legs says gaming saved his life Mother turned into ghost gamer for homeless charity Humble Bundle for example sells collections of video games online with proceeds usually benefitting both the developers and charities. But in its latest offering Humble has raised more than £10m exclusively for charities benefitting Ukraine. It is providing a bundle of 120 games and items usually valued at more than £1800 that it now offers for a minimum donation of only £30.52. Kamini Tiwari vice-president of social impact at Humble praised the players who have put up their money to get the games. We\re very very happy that our community is leaning in to support us she said. I think they also like us recognise that need is so great. We are constantly humbled - pardon the pun - by our community. Throughout the year and particularly during times of crisis and disaster it\s been great to see that across the gaming industry so many others are leaning in as well. Chucklefish Games makers of WarGroove and Starbound is one of the independent developers based in London that has offered up its games to the bundle. Alexis Trust communications manager at the studio said she felt it was their duty to help those in need. She said the firm\s partners Lithuania-based Hidden Layer Games which made the game Inmost is a two-man team from Ukraine and Russia. Throughout the project the team experienced first-hand the difficulty of working between borders during a time of political tension and so made the difficult decision to move together to Lithuania where their dream project could actually become a reality. When the Russian military invaded Ukraine we felt that it was our duty to extend that help to other families in whatever capacity we could. IMAGE SOURCE CHUCKLEFISH GAMES Image caption Chucklefish released indie hit Wargroove in 2019 But Humble isnt the only bundle right now aiming to help those in Ukraine. There is also the now-completed itch.io bundle which raised £4.7m by offering up 1000 games in exchange for a minimum donation of £7.56. Brandon Sheffield creative director of Necrosoft Games organised the bundle. He told the BBC he thinks the cause really resonated with people. And he said it was surprisingly easy to persuade developers of indie hits like Celeste and Superhot to help. Believe it or not it didn\t take very much convincing at all he said. Everyone was pretty much ready to help. The publisher Raw Fury joined the itch.io platform just so that they could put four of their games into this. The charities which benefitted from the itch.io bundle were International Medical Corps as well as the Voices of Children Foundation - a Ukrainian charity which provides support to children affected by trauma caused by war. I feel like that\s incredibly important for the future of Ukraine Mr Sheffield said. I chose this local organisation that\s already there. Because they\re there they\ve been like impromptu shelters going around and using the money that they\ve been donated to try to protect the people in Kyiv and other places where they can actually access them. And Andy Pearson chief marketing officer of British publisher PQube Games that has donated games for the bundle compared what was happening in the games industry to some of the big musical fundraising events of the past. It\s phenomenal. It exceeded the initial expectations and then continued to go on from there. It was amazing. I am thinking now - has this been done before? And it has - it\s like Live Aid - those big big events where you had lots of creators all coming together in one versus a single person trying to contribute. That\s what\s really helped establish this.]

On land in the air and at sea. In all Nato has about 40000 troops on its eastern border stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea. There is a new sense of urgency because we cannot take peace for granted Mr Stoltenberg told reporters. He warned Russia against using nuclear weapons in Ukraine calling for a halt to Moscow\s dangerous irresponsible nuclear rhetoric. He added that that any use of biological or chemical weapons would have far-reaching consequences while stressing that Nato was ready to protect and defend allies against any threat any time. Meanwhile US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington had concluded following a careful review of available information that Russian forces had committed war crimes by attacking civilians. Last week Mr Biden described Russian President Vladimir Putin as a war criminal. The remark has infuriated the Kremlin which shows no sign of backing down - a month into the invasion.

"Russia targets east Ukraine, says first phase over",The move is being seen as a possible change of strategy after the invasion faltered.,Russia targets east Ukraine says first phase over Published 26 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Russian forces have made gains in the south and are now looking to control the east Russia says it will focus its invasion of Ukraine on liberating the east signalling a possible shift in its strategy. The defence ministry said that the initial aims of the war were complete and that Russia had reduced the combat capacity of Ukraine. Russias invasion appeared aimed at swiftly capturing major cities and toppling the government. But it has stalled in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance. The main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been carried out said Sergei Rudskoy head of the General Staff\s main operations administration. The combat capabilities of the Ukrainian armed forces have been substantially reduced which allows us to concentrate our main efforts on achieving the main goal: the liberation of Donbas he added referring to an area in eastern Ukraine largely in the hands of Russian-backed separatists. Russias military has been bombarding and trying to encircle key Ukrainian cities such as the capital Kyiv which Gen Rudskoy characterised as an attempt to tie down Ukraines forces elsewhere in the country while Russia focuses on the east. Ukraine\s President Volodymyr Zelensky said his troops had landed powerful blows on Russia and called on Moscow to recognise the need for serious peace talks. By restraining Russia\s actions our defenders are leading the Russian leadership to a simple and logical idea: talk is necessary. Meaningful. Urgent. Fair. For the sake of the result not for the sake of the delay he said. The exact end goal of Russia\s invasion has not been made explicit but President Vladimir Putin described the aims as the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine characterising the government\s leaders as a neo-Nazi junta killing millions in a genocide of Russian speakers. The claims have no basis and Ukraine and its Western allies dismiss them as a pretext to carry out an unprovoked war. Russian troops first tried to encircle the capital Kyiv. But after bombarding and then seizing several towns to the north-west they were forced back by Ukraines military which is now trying to surround thousands of Russian soldiers. In a US assessment on Friday a defence official said that Russia had made no progress in its advance on Ukraines second largest city Kharkiv and that Ukraine could recapture Kherson. Russias army has had greater success in the south seizing towns and cities such as Kherson and making some gains in the east. Moscow now claims 93% of the Donbas region of Luhansk is under the control of Russian-backed separatists with 54% of the other part of Donbas Donetsk in their hands. More than a third of the entire area was under separatist control before the war began. Andriy Yermak chief of staff to Ukraine\s President Zelensky cautioned against the suggestion that Russia had abandoned plans to seize the rest of Ukraine. It\s a big danger before war is finished to make a public prognosis especially when you are fighting against one of the biggest armies in the world Mr Yermak told the Financial Times. What next for Russias war? Russia\s announcement that it will focus on the liberation of the Donbas is likely to mean a more concerted effort to push beyond the line of contact that separates Ukrainian government-held territory in the east of the country from the Russian backed separatist people\s republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. Western officials believe the announcement implies that Moscow knows that its pre-war strategy has failed. Russia is recognising that it can\t pursue its operations on multiple axes simultaneously one official said. As many as 10 new battalion tactical groups are being generated and put into Russias operations especially in the Donbas. Western officials have been concerned for some time that Russia will attempt to encircle and envelop Ukraines best fighting units which are stationed along the line of contact. If more Russian firepower particularly air power is concentrated in the east those concerns will rise. I hope that\s where the Western supply of arms will make a significant contribution to Ukrainian forces one official said. Is Russia admitting invasion not going to plan?

The number is far lower than the number of Russian casualties cited either by Ukraine or the US. Western officials say a seventh Russian general has been killed in action. Analysts have previously suggested Ukraine may be deliberately targeting senior Russian military officers. Ukraines death toll since the war began is now well into the thousands with 10 million people displaced within Ukraine and beyond its borders. So far the UN has only confirmed 1081 civilian deaths in Ukraine but the true number is far higher with 300 deaths reported in the attack on a theatre in Mariupol alone. More than 3.7 million people have fled abroad including 2.2 million to Poland. Russia says more than 400000 have fled there too.]

Deputy Peter Ferbrache President of the Policy and Resources Committee said Guernsey had taken steps in line with the UK to support Ukraine. He said: These include the quick implementation of sanctions against Russia and financial support for aid agencies supporting the Ukrainian people. But supporting these propositions through our parliamentary process is another important way we can make very clear that the Bailiwick stands with Ukraine and is firmly opposed to the Russian Federation\s invasion. He added: There is no justification for the horrific violence being inflicted upon innocent Ukrainian men women and children.

Ukraine war: WHO says attacks on health facilities are rising daily,The World Health Organization has verified more than 70 attacks on hospitals and healthcare facilities.,Ukraine war: WHO says attacks on health facilities are rising daily By Jim Reed Health reporter Published 26 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE VOLODYMYR MATSOKIN Image caption The central hospital in Izyum near Kharkiv after what Ukrainian authorities say was a Russian artillery attack There have been more than 70 separate attacks on hospitals ambulances and doctors in Ukraine with the number increasing on a daily basis says the World Health Organization (WHO). It says the targeting of healthcare facilities has become part of the strategy and tactics of modern warfare. A recent casualty on 8 March was the newly refurbished central hospital in Izyum south of Kharkiv. It was hit by what the Ukrainian authorities said were Russian shells. Video and photos posted online by the citys deputy mayor showed extensive damage to the main hospital building. A new reception area built last year was completely destroyed. The footage has been verified by the BBC and other media outlets although the exact circumstances of the attack are impossible to establish at this time. After the first bombing the windows of the hospital blew out the deputy mayor Volodymyr Matsokin told the BBC. A second attack destroyed the hospitals operating rooms he added. Ukraine: The doctors racing aid from the UK to the front line Oxygen stocks running dangerously low in Ukraine Ukraine war: The road to safety for Ukraines cancer children That day hospital staff were treating children pregnant women and three newborn babies as well as soldiers and civilians injured in fierce fighting in the region according to the Ukrainian authorities. They were sheltering in the basement at the time of the attack and no-one was killed. The government had invested millions to provide good facilities with modern equipment said Mr Matsokin. Patients had to climb out of the rubble on their own to escape. The BBC has contacted the Russian embassy in London about the attack but has received no response although in the past Moscow has denied deliberately targeting civilians. Since 24 February the WHO has reviewed and verified 72 separate attacks on healthcare facilities in Ukraine causing at least 71 deaths and 37 injuries. IMAGE SOURCE GOOGLE (L) AND VOLODYMR MATSOKIN (R) Image caption The central hospital in Izyum in August 2021 and after an attack on 8 March 2022 Most have damaged hospitals medical transports and supply stores but the WHO has also recorded the probable abduction or detention of healthcare staff and patients. We are concerned that this number is increasing daily the WHO\s Ukraine country representative Jarno Habicht told the BBC. Health facilities should be safe places for both doctors and nurses but also patients to turn to for treatment. This should not happen. Because the war in Ukraine is an international armed conflict between two states the Geneva Conventions apply. Expanded in the aftermath of World War Two the conventions set out the basic rights of civilians and military personnel and establish protection for the wounded and sick. They were ratified by what was then the Soviet Union in 1954. War in Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby WATCH: Destruction of Ukraines cities from above ZELENSKY: How Ukraines leader tailors his addresses READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Under Article 18 of the Conventions civilian hospitals may in no circumstances be the object of attack but shall at all times be respected and protected. A breach of that rule can be investigated by the International Criminal Court in the Hague and if found to be a war crime individual perpetrators can be prosecuted and punished. There are though exemptions to the Conventions. The protection from attack is lost if the medical facility is placed near a legitimate military target or is thought to be committing an act harmful to the enemy. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) that could include the use of a hospital as a shield for healthy fighters or the staging of a medical unit in a position which impedes an enemy attack. IMAGE SOURCE SERGEI ORLOV Image caption Aftermath of a Russian air strike on a maternity and children’s hospital in Mariupol Neve Gordon professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University of London said: What we have today in effect is a situation where hospitals and medical units have become fair game. If there are soldiers outside the hospital or it is simply next to a train station it can be attacked. Or it could be that a wounded soldier has a cellphone and is calling other troops and telling them that there is someone nearby. All these loopholes render it possible to claim the attack was legitimate. The ICRC says that in theory before targeting a hospital which might be in breach of those rules the attacking side should always give a warning with a time limit and the other side must have ignored that warning. There is no evidence this has happened in the Ukraine conflict. Prof Gordon would like to see a far stronger blanket ban on any attack on medical facilities under international law similar to the ban on torture adopted by the United Nations which came into force in 1987. From Vietnam to Syria Exemptions to the Geneva Conventions have been used to justify attacks on hospitals and medical units in post-World War Two conflicts from Korea and Vietnam onwards. The trend though appears to be accelerating rapidly driven in part by the use of ballistic missiles drones and other longer range munitions. The US advocacy group Physicians for Human Rights claims that Russian or local forces have been linked to at least 244 separate attacks on healthcare facilities in Syria since 2011. At one point the charity Médecins Sans Frontières even made the decision to stop sharing the GPS co-ordinates of some health clinics it operated with the Syrian government or its Russian allies amid concerns they were more likely to become direct targets as a result. Russian officials denied deliberately attacking hospitals in Syria and suggested jihadists in the country were routinely sheltering in protected civilian buildings. IMAGE SOURCE LUHANSK REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION Image caption A photograph released on 18 March by Ukrainian authorities showing a hospital damaged by shelling in Sievierodonetsk The WHO is concerned that all this means attacks on medical facilities are fast becoming part of the wider strategy and tactics of modern warfare regardless of the Geneva Conventions rules. Destroying health facilities it warned is about the destruction of hope and the denial of basic human rights. We\ve never seen globally... this rate of attacks on healthcare its emergencies director Michael Ryan told a news conference this week. This crisis is reaching a point where the health system in Ukraine is teetering on the brink. It needs to be supported… but how can you do that if the very infrastructure that those people will go in to support is under direct attack? You can follow Jim on Twitter.

Moscow said its initial aim was to destroy most of Ukraines air force and navy but its invasion has stalled and Kyiv is still in Ukrainian hands. Its efforts are now turning to the eastern Donbas region a senior military official said on Friday. So is this a step back? Or a tactical ploy? Western officials and analysts are divided. The announcement came on a day of developments elsewhere - heres the latest. Moscow says phase one is over Russian officials are claiming its army has accomplished its initial goals and will now focus on the complete liberation of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine. That part of the country contains two pro-Russian breakaway republics - Donetsk and Luhansk. Its too soon to tell if this represents a downgrading of the Kremlins ultimate ambitions but its definitely a change in emphasis. Russia could now concentrate its military offensives fully in Ukraines east. Read the full analysis from our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams. Biden meets troops in Poland IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption The US has sent around 12000 more troops to Europe since February US President Joe Biden visited troops at an American base in Poland near the border with Ukraine. He told them their deployment was part of the global struggle for democracy. You are the finest fighting force in the history of the world the president told the soldiers. What you\re doing is consequential. The stop at an airbase in Rzeszow was part of Mr Bidens three-day tour around Europe to rally allies. Fear in Ukraines south On the ground in Ukraine residents around the country are continuing to live in fear of Russian attacks. But some people - from a broad mix of backgrounds - have taken up arms.

Will Ukraine invasion push Japan to go nuclear?,Ex-PM Shinzo Abe shocked Japan by saying it should think about nuclear weapons - but he's not alone.,Will Ukraine invasion push Japan to go nuclear? By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes BBC News Tokyo Published 26 March Share Related Topics World War Two IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Former Japan PM Shinzo Abe has shocked Japan by saying it should think about nuclear weapons How could Japan ever contemplate getting nukes? Its a ridiculous idea. Japan is the only country in the world to have suffered a nuclear attack. Twice. Japan acquiring nuclear weapons is unthinkable. The people would never accept it. Right? Right. Or so the story has gone for the last 77 years. But in the last few weeks one Japanese politician has started suggesting otherwise. He is Shinzo Abe Japans longest serving post-war prime minister. Mr Abe has begun saying loudly and publicly that Japan should indeed think seriously and urgently about nuclear weapons. What we are talking about here is a fundamental break with Japans post-war commitment to pacifism - something enshrined in its post-war constitution. But its no coincidence this call-to-arms has come just as Russia has invaded Ukraine. For those like Mr Abe who have long yearned for a fully re-armed Japan the invasion of Ukraine serves as a useful example of what can happen to countries that dont defend themselves properly against bigger better armed and more aggressive neighbours. Richard McGregor of the Lowy Institute in Sydney and author of Asias Reckoning believes Abe thinks the time is right to push genuine debate in Japan and get on to the serious work of really trying to persuade the Japanese public. Women survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs I think that\s the holy grail here. I think he wants to try and move public opinion which has been frankly pretty stubborn he told the BBC. Pretty stubborn is an understatement. A survey conducted last year found 75% of Japanese want the country to sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Mr Abe\s call for a nuclear debate was met with outrage from atom bomb survivors\ groups in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Current Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (who is from Hiroshima) was quick to slap down his predecessor calling Mr Abe\s suggestion unacceptable. But Mr Abe is an astute politician. He knows Ukraine has come as a huge shock and he knows the Japanese public is worried about an unpredictable nuclear-armed North Korea and an increasingly aggressive China. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Japan\s current prime minister Fumio Kishida has called Mr Abe\s suggestion unacceptable Professor Yoichi Shimada is a conservative academic and long-time friend and advisor to Shinzo Abe. He thinks it\s imperative for Japan to have some kind of independent attacking power against China or North Korea Professor Shimada says. And that includes possibly a nuclear arsenal. But he also knows it would be suicidal for any politician to advocate for Japan to have nuclear weapons so he wants to activate the debate. The official position of the Japanese government now is to rely on US extended (nuclear) deterrents. But Japan doesn\t allow the United States to deploy nuclear weapons in Japan. That frankly is selfish. And so Mr Abe is not suggesting Japan build its own nuclear weapons. Hes suggesting it borrow some from America. Reality Check: Where are the worlds nuclear weapons? Largely forgotten in the post-cold war world is the fact is that Germany Belgium Italy and the Netherlands all store US nuclear weapons on their soil. More than that if there were a nuclear war these non-nuclear weapons states could deliver those weapons to targets on behalf of the US using their own aircraft. This is what Mr Abe is now proposing for Japan. It all still feels very far-fetched. Japanese law has explicitly banned any nuclear weapons from its soil since 1971. But Mr Abe is not alone in calling for that ban to now be debated. Ryozo Kato was Japans longest serving post-war ambassador to the United States and is perhaps the most ardent advocate of the Japan-US alliance. But he says with a nuclear-armed North Korea Japan can no longer just to rely on the US nuclear umbrella. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption North Korea has been ramping up its nuclear testing and long-range missile capabilities It may not be China he says. Some crazy leader may decide to fire nuclear weapons at Japan. Or they could use them for political intimidation. Japan is quite vulnerable to intimidation. We have to do more in defence terms. Japans pacifism was foisted on it by the American occupiers after World War II. Junking this has always seemed far-fetched. But its something both the US government and much of Japans political elite now support. Many Americans wish they hadn\t bound Japan with the peace constitution says Richard McGregor of the Lowy Institute. We shouldn\t forget that people like Abe also deeply resent the Americans imposing this constitution on them. They obviously bottled up their annoyance because they want the alliance with America. They know they can\t handle China on their own. There is a kind of seller\s remorse and buyer\s remorse on the peace constitution on both sides of the Pacific. In fact Japan is already far from being a true pacifist state whatever its constitution proclaims. Its navy is now amongst the most powerful in the world - quite a bit larger than Britains Royal Navy. What Japan lacks is long-range strike capability. Prof Yoichi Shimada says the consensus is that must now change. The position that Japan should have weapons which can hit the enemy territory I think that in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party the vast majority of the politicians thinks it\s necessary for Japan to have such capability. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Professor Shimada says the possibility of Russia waging nuclear war on Ukraine has spooked Japanese politicians Prof Shimada says Vladimir Putins threats against Ukraine have only made that more urgent. Would Putin press the nuclear button? President Putin actually referred to the use of nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear state. That amounts to a game changer for many politicians in Japan. Russia is one of the permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations. We all know that Putin is brutal. But it is very shocking even for him. Unlike Ukraine Japan has a full alliance with the United States and a commitment from Washington to retaliate against any country that attacks Japan including with nuclear weapons. That has worked while America has reigned supreme. But in Asia China is now rapidly approaching military parity with America. And then came the election of Donald Trump. Mr Trump said that you have to do your own security says Hiromi Murakami author of The Abe Legacy. He said it explicitly. But I think the overall trend of US is basically the same as Mr Trump. You can\t totally rely on the US anymore. For some like Ambassador Kato the answer is to strengthen the US-Japan alliance - and for Japan to take on more of the burden of defending its own neighbourhood. For Prof Shimada it could mean one day Japan will have to develop its own nuclear deterrent. One thing everyone I spoke to agreed is that Japan must somehow get over the taboo of talking about its own defence. This has been avoided for many many years. says Ms Murakami. But the Japanese leadership really needs to bring this to the table and show it to the public. We can\t live in this fake world any longer. This Ukraine situation is really shocking and I hope that it will trigger the leadership and the general public to really think.]

Visits to sponsors homes will begin on Monday the Executive Office confirmed. The Homes for Ukraine scheme has been criticised for being slow and difficult to find matches. Therese Gorman in Lisburn has been trying to find a refugee to sponsor. She told BBC Radio Ulster\s Evening Extra programme it had been a minefield.

Homes for Ukraine: Its sad slow and frustrating Where have Ukraines 10 million refugees gone? And I\m here with this big empty house wanting to help and it\s very frustrating I can\t move this any way forward without some sort of government help. I\ve just got nowhere. I\ve tried so hard. Where other countries seem to be saying come on ahead no visas no hassle no anything just come ours seems to be fraught with difficulty it\s just a mine field and it\s taken hours and hours and actually I haven\t made any contact with anybody. Process may not work for everyone An Executive Office spokesperson said: We have raised with the UK government the need for them to provide further assistance in making links through the contacts that the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office has in Ukraine and the surrounding region. They said the matching process may not work for everyone. Anyone who has registered an interest in providing accommodation for a refugee under the Homes for Ukraine scheme and does not know a Ukrainian person or family to sponsor is encouraged to make contact with local community or faith based organisations to help facilitate the matching process. Ukrainian refugees allowed to bring pets Anyone who is not able to find a match under the Homes for Ukraine Scheme will have further opportunities to provide support to a refugee when other schemes are developed as part of the ongoing humanitarian effort. The visa required to travel here under the Homes for Ukraine Scheme is subject to satisfactory checks carried out by the Home Office on both the sponsor and refugee. The executive office added they have put arrangements in place for home visits to take place from Monday.]

EU signs US gas deal to curb reliance on Russia,The liquefied natural gas deal with US is part of EU attempts to reduce reliance on Russian energy.,EU signs US gas deal to curb reliance on Russia Published 25 March comments Comments Share IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES The US and the EU have announced a major deal on liquified natural gas in an attempt to reduce Europes reliance on Russian energy. The agreement will see the US provide the EU with extra gas equivalent to around 10% of the gas it currently gets from Russia by the end of the year. The bloc has already said it will cut Russian gas use in response to Russias invasion of Ukraine. Russia currently supplies about 40% of the EUs gas needs. The new deal will involve the US and other countries supplying an extra 15 billion cubic metres of gas on top of last years 22 billion cubic metres. The new total will represent around 24% of the gas currently imported from Russia. The eventual aim is for the US and international partners to provide about 50 billion cubic metres per year to the EU. Cutting reliance on Russia will mean generating more renewable energy and improving energy efficiency as well as increasing imports. Ukraine war: How reliant is the world on Russia for oil and gas? Why are gas bills so high and whats the energy price cap? The deal was announced on Friday during a three-day visit by US President Joe Biden to Brussels. Mr Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen discussed Russias invasion of Ukraine and offered fresh support to Kyiv. Putin is using Russia\s energy resources to coerce and manipulate its neighbours Mr Biden told reporters in Brussels. He\s used the profits to drive his war machine. He said the long term benefits of the deal would outweigh the short term pain that reducing Russian gas supplies would cause. I know that eliminating Russian gas will have costs for Europe but it\s not only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint it\s going to put us on a much stronger strategic footing. President von der Leyen said: We want as Europeans to diversify away from Russia towards suppliers that we trust that are friends and that are reliable. She pointed out that the target 50 billion cubic metres per year is replacing one-third already of the Russian gas going to Europe today. So we are right on track now to diversify away from Russian gas. The EU gets 40% of its gas from Russia. If its to wean itself off that dependency it needs to get its energy elsewhere. The question is where from? Gas is already piped from Norway - but those pipelines are already operating at maximum capacity. The EU gets relatively little from the North Sea. New supplies will have to come from further afield in the form of LNG - gas thats been chilled and liquified. But theres already intense competition for LNG supplies from countries such as Algeria and Qatar and thats been pushing up prices. The 50 billion cubic metres of gas a year from the US - more than double the current quantity - would certainly be welcome. But it still wouldnt fill the gap if Russian supplies were removed. There are also question marks over how much gas the US can supply how quickly it can increase exports to the EU - and how much those shipments will cost. The EU has been enjoying cheap gas for many years - but now it seems to have accepted that era is coming to an end. Russias war with Ukraine has helped push energy prices to record highs. Energy prices were already rising before the invasion as economies started to recover from the Covid crisis. The Ukraine invasion prompted the EU to pledge to cut Russian gas use by two-thirds this year by hiking imports from other countries and boosting renewable energy. The White House said that greater energy efficiency can be immediately achieved through increasing the use of smart thermostats and heat pumps. The EU said that reductions through energy savings in homes can replace 15.5 billion cubic metres this year and that accelerating wind and solar deployment can replace 20 billion cubic metres. The EUs goal is to save 170 billion cubic metres by 2030 through energy efficiency and by using renewable energy. That 170 billion on top of the planned 50 billion of additional gas from the US and other countries means Europes reliance on Russian gas could be replaced by 2030. Russia sanctions In response to Russias invasion of Ukraine the US is banning all Russian oil and gas imports and the UK will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. The EU has said it will switch to alternative supplies and make Europe independent from Russian energy well before 2030. Germany has put on hold permission for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to open. Meanwhile in the UK petrol prices have hit record highs as oil and gas costs soar. Oil jumped to $139 a barrel at one point earlier this month the highest level for almost 14 years while wholesale gas prices for next-day delivery more than doubled.]

UK minister seeks talks on scheme replacing EU aid fund,Neil O'Brien speaks after Welsh ministers complained of not being involved in plans for the fund.,UK minister seeks talks on scheme replacing EU aid fund By Felicity Evans Political editor Wales Published 23 March Share Related Topics Brexit IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption The A465 near Ebbw Vale was part funded by EU financial aid A UK minister says he has been seeking a meeting with the Welsh economy minister about a new fund to replace EU aid for Wales poorest areas. Minister for Levelling Up Neil O\Brien said he wanted to talk to Vaughan Gething but Welsh ministers were still mulling the offer of a meeting. Welsh ministers have criticised the UK government for not involving them in plans for the Shared Prosperity Fund. Welsh ministers said agreement can be reached based on joint decision making. What does levelling up mean for Wales? Wales to get £46m of EU funds replacement pilot Ministers in Cardiff have also complained that the fund leaves Wales worse off than under the original EU scheme. The details of how the new fund will work have yet to be announced. Mr O\Brien told a committee of Welsh MPs on Wednesday: I am keen to talk about it with my equivalent Vaughan Gething in Wales but at the moment I think they are still deciding if they want to engage in that way. Addressing the Welsh Affairs Committee he said he wanted the Welsh government to be involved in shaping the scheme but they are mulling how they want to play this. We are in the process of talking to Welsh local authorities and other stakeholders he said. I am keen to meet with and work with the Welsh government. Money in local leaders hands Mr OBrien said officials of the two governments were meeting regularly and Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove had met the first ministers of Wales and Scotland before Christmas. We are very open to the Welsh government shaping all the different dimensions of this fund he said. But he also added that UK ministers want local authorities to decide how to spend the money. The one thing we would be keen on and I think this is probably the thing that is making them wonder about whether to meet is that we really want to allocate the funding fully out to local regions within Wales. We\d like to put the money in the hands of local leaders. How has the Welsh government responded? A Welsh government spokesperson said: Welsh ministers have been clear in meetings and in public that an agreement can be reached on the basis of joint decision making. A credible agreement that works for jobs and communities in Wales must go beyond consultation and include a joint approach to the design and delivery of programmes and projects. Officials from both governments are in ongoing dialogue on these issues and Welsh ministers look forward to meeting with UK ministers to discuss their response to our offer of a way forward.

Brexit: 'More needed to explain impact of EU law on NI',A Lords committee warns more information is required on how legal updates will affect Northern Ireland.,Brexit: More needed to explain impact of EU law on NI By John Campbell BBC News NI Economics & Business Editor Published 22 March comments Comments Share Related Topics Brexit IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES/PAUL FAITH Image caption The protocol led to inspections at ports on certain goods imported into Northern Ireland from Great Britain The UK and EU need to do more to explain how updates to EU law could impact Northern Ireland a House of Lords committee has warned. A significant amount of EU law continues to apply in NI under the terms of the Protocol. That body of law is subject to constant technical update and revision. The Lords sub-committee on the protocol says far too much government documentation inadequately explains the implications of EU legislation for NI. The protocol is the Brexit deal that prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EUs single market for goods. That means many EU laws on product standards customs VAT and state aid continue to apply in Northern Ireland. If the EU is bringing forward entirely new laws which will affect Northern Ireland there is a formal consultation process with the UK government through the oversight body known as the Joint Committee. However if the EU is amending or replacing existing laws they automatically apply in Northern Ireland - what is known as dynamic regulatory alignment. In those cases the scrutiny process is based on the UK government producing explanatory memoranda (EM). Extremely poor The Lords sub-committee uses these EMs to decide which issues need detailed analysis. It says these EMs are of inconsistent quality describing some as extremely poor. It praises the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) for the quality of its submissions. However it adds: Too many documents from other departments do not contain sufficient information about the implications of EU legislation for Northern Ireland. The committee suggests the ongoing negotiations on the protocol are being used as an excuse to provide minimal information. Notwithstanding the ongoing discussions... the government has an obligation in the meantime to set out the full implications of EU legislation applying to Northern Ireland under the protocol as it currently operates it says. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? UK and Irish prime ministers discuss protocol What is Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol? The committee also tackles the wider issue of the protocol\s democratic deficit. That refers to the fact that the EU laws which continue to apply in Northern Ireland are not subject to any consent from parliamentarians either at Westminster or Stormont. In October the EU published proposals aimed at enhancing consultation with Northern Ireland business and civic groups. It also said it is planning a website showing EU legislation applicable to Northern Ireland which could include information on pending public consultations for relevant measures. Particular needs The committee says these measures are welcome as far as they go but the EU needs to do more. It suggests a number of ideas such as providing a means for the Northern Ireland Assembly to express a collective view or decision on EU legislation. IMAGE SOURCE PETER DAZELEY/GETTY Image caption If the EU is amending or replacing existing laws they automatically apply in Northern Ireland That could take the form of pre-legislative consultation or a Legislative Consent Mechanism - a non-binding Stormont vote. The EU is likely to be resistant to measures which would give Stormont greater rights than EEA countries - they are non-EU single market participants like Norway. However the committee\s chairman Lord Jay of Ewelme told the BBC that Northern Ireland\s situation was not comparable with the EEA and there does need to be something which takes account of the particular needs of Northern Ireland at a very sensitive time.]
Morlais tidal project on Anglesey gets £31m EU funding,The sum is likely to be the last large grant from the EU's regional funding programme.,Morlais tidal project on Anglesey gets £31m EU funding Published 22 March Share IMAGE SOURCE BLEDDYN JONES-PEARSON Image caption The Morlais scheme in Anglesey aims to develop tidal power generation technologies A major tidal project off Anglesey will benefit from £31m of funding in what is likely to be the last large grant from the EUs regional funding programme. Wales Climate Change Minister Julie James confirmed the funding would be given to Menter Môn for the Morlais infrastructure project. The project aims to develop tidal power generation technologies by providing grid connectivity. It is also expected to create jobs and boost skills in the area. Action on green energy needed now says trade body Power project could be devastating for seabirds No better time to seek investors says deal boss The Morlais project would see a development on 35 sq km (13 sq miles) of seabed generating up to 240MW of electricity from the power of the tides in the Irish Sea. It would make it one of the largest tidal stream energy sites in the world. But environmentalists have warned the plans could have a devastating impact on seabird populations. The Crown Estate will invest a further £1.2m in the Morlais project to support the delivery of its environmental monitoring and mitigation package. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption There are concerns about the impact of the project on local wildlife Ms James said the project is an opportunity for the industry to establish clean resilient and ethical power as a significant part of the global energy system. North Wales minister Lesley Griffiths added: Anglesey and north Wales as a whole are very well placed to play a key role in innovative low carbon energy generation which benefits local communities. Not only will the project be a boost to future low carbon energy production but will also generate jobs and skills in the area. Unlocking the tidal stream sector Wales economy minister Vaughan Gething said there have been considerable opportunities for the marine energy sector through European structural fund programmes. There is no doubt EU funds have been essential in supporting businesses to exploit the great potential of Wales\ wave and tidal resources with a significant investment of £105m in marine energy projects in Wales he said. The Morlais infrastructure project is key to unlocking the development of the tidal stream sector in north Wales bringing a number of economic benefits to the region. With the construction and testing of devices and preparation of infrastructure the project will attract further sector investment enabling the supply chain to grow and with it create higher-skilled jobs.]

Now EU leaders who are here for a two-day summit hope to project an image of unity in the face of Russian aggression in Ukraine. Thats easy when they discuss the big picture. But some details up for debate are clearly divisive amongst member states: such as energy prices impacted by the war EU common defence plans and the enlargement of the bloc to include Ukraine. Yet the bureaucratic often bickering behemoth that is the EU has already been transformed by the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Lets take a step back to get some perspective: Germany is re-booting its military after decades of squeamishness due to the countrys role in World War Two The EU has slapped unprecedented financial sanctions on Russia despite costs to European businesses The EUs Temporary Protection Directive has been used for the first time to help Ukrainian refugees work and live in the bloc- a divisive topic during the 2015 migrant crisis Brussels is buying and supplying weapons for the first time ever to a country at war The Energy Transition - so often put on a backburner by EU countries - promises to be a revolution with new plans to reduce heavy reliance on Russian gas EU outliers Poland and Hungary in Brussels bad books for years are back in the fold as a result of the current crisis Brussels cooperation and co-ordination with Nato and the US are smoother and closer than theyve been in a long time Is this a temporary blip or are we looking at a Brussels rebirth; an EU 2.0? The EU was already aware - certainly after the 2016 Brexit vote if not before - that it needed some serious self-improvement. The bloc was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize back in 2012 for over six decades contributing to the advancement of peace and reconciliation democracy and human rights in Europe. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption EU member states have sent defensive weapons to Ukraine but face demands for greater support But in the eyes of many Europeans Brussels became seen as a home for neo-liberalism rather than liberalism. A promoter of trade deals prioritising big business and a maker of dirty migrant deals (with Turkey for example) to keep refugees from reaching EU shores. A bloc that along with many national governments was perceived as helping banks instead of families after the 2008 economic crisis. An entity decades after the Second World War that had lost its vision mission and recognition as a force for peace in Europe. Populism nationalism and illiberalism became familiar faces in European politics as voters looked for a better fit. EU countries fell out over migration eurozone reform and more. Conspiracy theories flourished as trust in Brussels and traditional politicians waned. Strongman leaders like Hungary\s Viktor Orban Turkey\s Recep Erdogan America\s Donald Trump and Russia\s Vladimir Putin were increasingly admired. Then in 2020 the Covid pandemic prompted a reset. After an unedifying start Brussels was perceived as working in the public interest. Member states seemed more united opinion polls were approving. The EUs Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell has appealed to EU leaders to display the same drive and resolve shown in face of Covid when dealing with the Russia-Ukraine crisis and resulting challenges. This war on European soil has refocused EU minds as to what the bloc could - or should - stand for. Vladimir Putins assault on Ukraine is also seen by the EU majority as a geopolitical attack on European security as a whole. EPA The war in Ukraine is an immense trauma a human political humanitarian drama and its undoubtedly an element thatll lead to completely redefining the architecture of our Europe Emmanuel Macron French President But this two-day informal summit could well expose cracks in this new-found EU unity. All EU leaders fret about rising energy costs and the impact back home of Russia sanctions and possible counter sanctions. But they disagree on what to do about it. Some call for an EU-wide solution - that is new funds from Brussels. Others like Germany and the Netherlands say no. Emmanuel Macron is the host of the summit since France currently holds the rotating EU presidency. Hes long been a champion of a stronger more independent Europe weaning itself off food technology and energy imports and building up its own defence force to work alongside Nato. But the prospect of a European Army (under French command) remains an unlikely prospect. Instead EU countries will discuss better co-ordination and the pooling of military resources... while likely arguing over which nations should win the best contracts. Getty Images There is a war in Europe. My wish is for the EU to unleash its strength and continue to act in unity to ensure peace in Europe has a good perspective. That is what is at stake now Olaf Scholz (R) German Chancellor As for migration. two million Ukrainians have already fled the country. Depending on how long the misery and violence continue many more could arrive in the EU. Diplomats Ive spoken to predict that funding housing and relocating millions across different member states could yet prove difficult longer term.

Climate change: EU unveils plan to end reliance on Russian gas,The EU Commission outlines an ambitious roadmap to cut imports of Russian gas by two thirds in a year.,Climate change: EU unveils plan to end reliance on Russian gas By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Published 8 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE NATHAN STIRK As countries scramble to reduce their reliance on Russias oil and gas in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine few places are as exposed as the European Union. The EU gets roughly 40% of its gas from Russia: According to figures from research group Transport & Environment this dependence costs around $118m a day. But moving with a speed few thought possible the EU has now laid out a strategy that could cut reliance on this fuel source by two thirds within a year. The REPowerEU plan aims to make Europe independent of Russian fossil fuels by 2030 but the initial efforts focus solely on gas. The roadmap essentially proposes finding alternative supplies of gas in the next few months and boosting energy efficiency while doubling down on greener sources of power in the medium to longer term. It\s hard bloody hard said EU Commission vice president Frans Timmermans. But it\s possible if we\re willing to go further and faster than we\ve done before. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Part of the Yamal pipeline that brings gas from Russia to Europe The Commissions new proposals will make it a legal requirement for EU countries to ensure they have a minimum level of gas storage. The aim is to have gas stocks at 90% of capacity by the Autumn up from around 30% now. Discussions are ongoing with existing gas suppliers including Norway Algeria and Azerbaijan to boost flows. The plan envisages ending reliance on all Russian fossil fuels well before 2030. In the short term gas should be sourced from the US and Africa while some countries may need to use more coal in the months ahead. The EU also proposes a massive ramping up of renewables biogas and hydrogen. Unite against climate change - Ukraine scientist World warned of irreversible climate impacts While carbon emissions may rise in the short term the longer-term aim is a speedier transition to sustainable sources. Another key focus in the coming months will be increased imports of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) from suppliers including the US Qatar and Australia. But with Germany announcing plans for two new LNG terminals to increase supplies some experts are worried that this could increase longer term dependency on fossil fuels. I think we\re living in a tricky time that there\s so much political pressure to make these energy policy decisions said Prof Paula Kivimaa from the Finnish Environment Institute and the University of Sussex. But we also must look beyond the next couple of years. If Germany builds new LNG infrastructure there is a risk that it kind of locks it in for the foreseeable future. As well as diversifying gas supplies the Commission also believes the reliance on Russia will be eased as there are new renewable energy projects due to come online. The EU says that countries should look to use the revenues raised from the Emissions Trading Scheme which have almost doubled since 2020 to pay for these green energy sources. But in the next few months dirtier energy sources like coal may also be needed. There is some capacity from the power sector to generate more electricity with coal and biofuels and there\s also some new wind and solar products coming online said Carlos Torres Diaz head of gas and power markets research at analysts Rystad Energy. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Rooftop solar power could meet a quarter of EU electricity needs So this could be a way of reducing some of the gas consumption as the power sector is the largest consumer of gas. This could be done within this year. Frans Timmermans recognised that for some countries it might make sense to switch to coal in the short term but this could bring its own difficulties. Europe gets around 30% of its coal from Russia. Alternative supplies from countries like South Africa and Columbia are not easily obtained. Any switch to coal would also rapidly boost carbon emissions a trend thats already well underway. We\ve already seen the emissions from coal increase last year because of an increase of 18% in coal power generation said Carlos Torres Diaz. So if this continues during 2022 emissions will continue to rise because coal power generation has more or less twice as much emissions as gas generation. The Commission document also says that renewable energy projects must be fast tracked and says there is huge potential in domestic rooftop solar power. Up to a quarter of the blocs electricity consumption could be generated from panels on homes farms and commercial building the Commission says. To reduce reliance on natural gas from whatever source the Commission is also calling for a huge ramp up in biogas which is made from agricultural and food waste. With the extra investment in renewables this could also lead to a significant increase in green hydrogen which can be made from wind and solar power. The Commission is now calling for a quadrupling of hydrogen use by 2030.

There may well be some dissenting voices when EU leaders meet in Versailles later this week. They will all recognise that all these proposed changes will not come cheap. Campaigners say that Europes governments must ensure the very poorest are protected. In parallel with introducing sanctions a huge package of support must be deployed to ensure that they do not deepen Europe\s ongoing energy poverty crisis and that no one has to choose between heating and eating said Mike Davis from Global Witness who are calling for a full oil and gas embargo on Russia. The need for everyone to be able to afford to heat their home must come before worries about economic growth. The Commission will be encouraging countries to use a toolbox of measures to protect consumers including windfall taxes on the profits of energy companies. But while the poorest may receive some protection in the short term there will be added pain on the price front. I don\t see a simple way for to shield the consumers from the costs that all of this transition will imply said Carlos Torres Diaz from Rystad. Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.

NI Protocol: Edwin Poots wants EU pressed on seeds importation rules,The agriculture minster wants more cereals and potatoes grown locally in response to the Ukraine war.,NI Protocol: Edwin Poots wants EU pressed on seeds importation rules By John Campbell BBC News NI Economics & Business Editor Published 10 March Share Related Topics Brexit IMAGE SOURCE PHOTOATTRACTIVE Image caption Northern Irelands agriculture minister wants more wheat barley and potatoes grown locally Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots has asked the UK government to press the EU to relax rules on importing agriculture seeds to Northern Ireland. Mr Poots says he wants farmers to grow more cereal crops and potatoes in response to the Ukraine war. Ukraine and Russia are major exporters of basic foodstuffs and the war has hit crop production driving up prices. The seeds trade comes under the Northern Ireland Protocol and involves an onerous import process. Mr Poots told the BBC: We\re looking at a situation where we\re going to have a shortage of wheat and barley and that will lead to all sorts of problems. So I want to see more wheat barley and potatoes grown in NI. You\ve grace periods on quite a number of things. I want grace periods on seeds and plants products. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem UK and EU determined to find durable solutions The NI Protocol and its economic impact The Ulster Farmers Union (UFU) has previously complained that new inspection and certification processes were limiting the varieties of seed available from Great Britain. The organisation has also said it was becoming uneconomical to order smaller quantities of seeds. Under the protocol there is an outright prohibition on moving seed potatoes from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland produces relatively little cereal with agriculture more focused on livestock. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption The Republic of Ireland imports about 5.5m tonnes of grain a year equivalent to 60% of supply Official figures suggest that in 2020 only about 1% of farms in Northern Ireland were classified as being predominately cereal producers. The total output of field crops was estimated at £62m whereas livestock output was estimated at £1.8bn. Earlier this week Irelands minister for agriculture Charlie McConalogue had called on farmers to grow more cereal crops. Ireland imports about 5.5m tonnes of grain a year equivalent to 60% of supply. Minister McConalogue said it was fortunate that Ireland was still early in the planting season providing the opportunity to grow more grain. However farm organisations have been lukewarm on the proposal. Tim Cullinan president of the Irish Farmers\ Association said: It is far from certain that asking all farmers to plant crops is the best use of the resources that are likely to be available to us.]

Brexit: UK and EU 'still determined to find solutions to protocol',The joint committee met on Tuesday to discuss issues around the Northern Ireland Protocol.,Brexit: UK and EU still determined to find solutions to protocol By John Campbell BBC News NI Economics & Business Editor Published 8 March comments Comments Share Related Topics Brexit IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES The UK and EU said they remain determined to find durable solutions to the issues around the Northern Ireland Protocol. The two sides issued a joint statement after a meeting of senior officials. The negotiators met in a body known as the Specialised Committee. It deals with technical issues and can make recommendations to the lead negotiators UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commission Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič. The statement said: Both parties underlined their ongoing determination to ensure that outstanding issues in the context of the protocol are addressed and durable solutions are found as soon as possible for the benefit of people and businesses in Northern Ireland. In addition the EU and the UK reiterated the importance of further engagement with business groups civil society and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland and committed to further joint engagements. Officials representing the NI Executive attended the meeting as part of the UK delegation. IMAGE SOURCE JOHANNA GERON/REUTERS Image caption British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commissioner in charge of Brexit negotiations Maroš Šefčovič The protocol is the Brexit deal which prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EUs single market for goods. That also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK something the EU accepts is causing difficulties for many businesses. The EU has agreed in principle that GB goods which are going to stay in Northern Ireland should be subject to fewer checks and controls than those which are due to travel onwards to the Republic of Ireland and the wider EU. But there is still a big difference between the UK and EU about how that should be implemented and what should be considered a reasonable level of risk to the EU single market. The NI Protocol and its economic impact A simple guide to the Brexit border problem The joint committee previously met in late February. At that time Mrs Truss and Mr Šefčovič said they were determined that outstanding issues would be addressed. A senior EU official suggested that the talks would happen in a more discreet way in the run up to the Northern Ireland Assembly elections in May. It is not yet clear if or how the war in Ukraine will affect the negotiations. Mrs Truss and Mr Šefčovič have previously made a joint statement expressing a wish for a positive EU-UK relationship which would allow for co-operation on common global challenges. Last week Mrs Truss was a guest at an emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels alongside the US secretary of state and Canadas foreign minister. However EU and UK sources have both played down the prospect that the changed environment could unlock rapid progress.]
"UK owes EU money over customs fraud, court rules",European judges say the tax authorities did not collect correct taxes on imports of undervalued Chinese clothing.,UK owes EU money over customs fraud court rules Published 8 March Share IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS The UK faces making a potentially hefty payment to the EU after its top court ruled it did too little to prevent fraud on imports of Chinese clothing. European judges said HMRC failed to pass on the correct amount of tax revenue to the EU on imports between 2011 and 2017. The European Commission took legal action in 2018 arguing it was owed €2.7bn (£2.4bn). The UK government said it would respond to the judgement in due course. The UK was accused of taking inadequate steps to prevent fraud after it was warned about the problem by the EUs watchdog Olaf in 2017. EU member states had been warned by Olaf about the risk of undervalued clothing and footwear coming from China via shell companies. EU seeks £2.4bn customs duties from UK MEPs back probe on unpaid UK tariffs A quick guide to whats in the Brexit deal In a ruling on Tuesday the European Court of Justice (ECJ) upheld the commissions claim the UK had not paid the correct tax revenue to the EU. However it did not agree with how the commission calculated what exactly it is owed. The commission will now have to recalculate a final claim. EU members have to pass on a share of the taxes that they collect on imports to the commission as part of their contribution to the EU budget. The BBC has asked the commission for a comment. A UK government spokesperson said: Throughout we\ve made the case that we took reasonable and proportionate steps to tackle the fraud in question and that the Commission vastly overstated the size and severity of the alleged fraud. The UK has always and continues to take customs fraud very seriously and evolves its response as new threats emerge. The UK cut formal ties with the EU in January 2021 following an 11-month transition period after it officially left the bloc. However the ECJ retains the power to make rulings over cases relating to how the UK applied EU law before Brexit took place.]

Katya Adler Europe editor @BBCkatyaadler on Twitter Published 7 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline was an early casualty of Germanys change of heart over Russia You know that feeling when youre running downhill going so fast that you seem to lose control of your own feet? Thats where the EU appears to be at the moment. Crushing financial sanctions on Russia that hurt European business. Brussels purchasing and sending weapons to a non-EU country at war. Germany beefing up its military despite post-World War Two queasiness. Staunchly neutral Finland and Sweden thinking of joining Nato. The blocs asylum procedure pushed aside to accommodate fleeing Ukrainians in whats described as Europes biggest refugee crisis since 1945. Once dismissed as impossible - or at least hugely improbable - from one day to the next EU revolutions provoked by the Russia-Ukraine crisis have been happening thick and fast. The next seismic change bubbling in Brussels? A looming energy revolution provoked by a simple question: Whats the point of punitive financial sanctions if Vladimir Putins war chest is refilled on a daily basis with oil and gas revenues? The EU depends on Russia for 40% of its natural gas and a quarter of its oil imports. EU countries pay about €1bn a day to Moscow for those supplies according to Bruegel the Brussels-based think tank. The US - which is far less reliant on Russian energy supplies than Europe - says its considering banning Russian oil imports as part of its sanctions against the Kremlin. On Monday standing next to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken Lithuania\s foreign minister agreed. We cannot pay for oil and gas with Ukrainian blood he said. Price woes and the electorate Along with other eastern European Nato and EU members Lithuania views Vladimir Putin - with his ambitions to change Europes geopolitical order in Moscows favour - as an active security threat. The West must fight Russia with all means available said Lithuania\s president. To avoid World War Three. But other EU countries such as big powers Germany and Italy - far more reliant on Russian energy than most - feel more threatened by the prospect of skyrocketing energy prices that would surely follow any sanctions on Russian oil or gas imports. Energy prices are already painfully high across the continent. Until Russias attacks on Ukraine the majority of Germans supported Nord Stream 2 their new gas pipeline direct from Russia. The pipeline has been frozen as part of EU sanctions against Russia but Berlin fears public opinion could turn if Germans suddenly cant fill their cars with petrol or afford to heat their homes. Germanys Federation of Industries the BDI has warned that soaring prices could crush the EUs largest economy forcing factory and other German business closures with a rippling effect across the single market. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Anti-nuclear sentiment has always been strong in Germany Frances Emmanuel Macron is nervous too. He hopes to be re-elected president next month. The last time he was blamed for petrol price hikes in France it sparked months of massive street protests by the gilets jaunes the yellow jackets so-called because of the high-visibility vests they wore. So while on the world stage President Macron presents himself as the European champion of carbon neutrality energy prices are such a sensitive issue in France that he introduced €100 bonuses for the poorest voters this winter to mitigate fossil fuel prices as part of his re-election bid. Its notable too that French energy giant Total says its staying put in Russia for now despite the Kremlins onslaught against Ukraine while competitors BP and Shell have voluntarily pulled out. Ukraine needs EU action now So are energy sanctions against Russia just the latest example of an EU impossible that will suddenly become reality? The issue will be discussed in the European Parliament on Tuesday and among EU leaders at their Thursday summit. When I speak to EU naysayers they talk defensively not only about the dangers of domestic blowback but also potential aftershocks in the global energy market. At the moment we\re speaking with one voice alongside Latin America regarding Russian aggression one diplomat told me. But what would happen if the Argentine economy implodes as a result of energy price hikes and scarcity and the EU and the West is blamed for that? So for the moment the EU is clinging to what it views as safer ground. On Monday EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc would be speeding up efforts to wean itself off Russian energy. These include: finding reliable alternative suppliers (such as Qatar and Azerbaijan) improving energy efficiency eg renovating buildings and using artificial intelligence to effectively manage the energy grid massive investment in renewables such as solar wind and hydrogen already planned under the European Green Deal. Russias actions in Ukraine mean Brussels now views the Climate Question as a question of security. Energy security. Germanys new chancellor took the worlds breath away a week ago by reversing his countrys defence policy sending weapons to Ukraine and announcing a €100bn investment in the German military. His finance minister has also announced a €200bn investment in renewable and alternative energy sources. Germanys need is acute as it has all but phased out nuclear energy as well as phasing out coal. But those plans for renewable energies alternative suppliers and a clean energy divorce from Russia will take time. Something Ukraine just does not have.

Ukraine invasion: EU shuts airspace to Russian planes,"Russian planes will now be unable to land in, take off from or fly over any EU nation.",Ukraine invasion: EU shuts airspace to Russian planes Published 27 February Share The EU has imposed a blanket flight ban on Russian planes the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has announced. We are shutting down EU airspace for Russian-owned Russian-registered or Russian-controlled aircraft she said. All such planes including the private jets of oligarchs will now be unable to land in take off from or fly over any EU nation. Russian planes have also been banned from UK airspace. Russias biggest airline Aeroflot said it would cancel all flights to European destinations until further notice in a retaliatory move on Sunday. Ahead of the decision European countries had been closing their airspace one by one. Germany said its ban would last three months. Departure boards at Moscows Domodedovo and Sheremetyevo airports showed dozens of cancellations on Sunday including flights to Paris Vienna and Kaliningrad. Russias S7 Airlines said on Facebook it would cancel flights to many of its European destinations until at least 13 March. Russia has been responding with tit-for-tat restrictions on countries banning its flights. The Commission president said that the EU was also going to ban Russia\s state-owned news outlets Sputnik and Russia Today widely seen as a mouthpiece for the Kremlin. We are developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe she said. Is Russias invasion going as expected? Zelensky: A president rising to the moment Miles of queues at borders to flee invasion The restrictions on flights will require Russian airlines to take circuitous routes resulting in longer flight times. Commercial airlines are also avoiding airspace around Ukraine Moldova and Belarus following Russias invasion. In the US Delta Air Lines said it would suspend a flight booking agreement with Russias Aeroflot. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption All Russian-registered planes will be affected by the flight ban The UKs ban on Russian flights led Moscow to retaliate with a similar curb on British planes. Virgin Atlantic said avoiding Russia would add between 15 minutes and an hour to its flights between the UK and India and Pakistan. Australian airline Qantas said it would use a longer route for its direct flight between Darwin and London that does not overfly Russia.

Ukraine crisis: Tough and emotional summit as EU leaders seek unity,"Former Iron Curtain countries feel exposed, but some EU leaders argue against ""nuclear"" measures.",Ukraine crisis: Tough and emotional summit as EU leaders seek unity Katya Adler Europe editor @BBCkatyaadler on Twitter Published 25 February Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Just before the emergency EU leaders meeting on Ukraine started a Brussels official told us he thought this would be one of the toughest and most emotional EU summits ever. From what I heard went on behind closed doors he wasnt wrong. Russias actions in Ukraine impact many EU members directly. It feels personal to them. Their belief: that Vladimir Putin has his eye on much more than Ukraine - that he wants to redesign the security architecture of Europe in his favour. Countries in central and eastern Europe which used to be behind the Iron Curtain - now EU and Nato members - feel very exposed. Particularly the Baltic States which border Russia. They fear the Kremlin intends to destabilise them with cyber attacks and more disinformation campaigns aimed at their ethnic Russian communities. Russia attacks Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS: Why is Putin invading Ukraine? FROM KYIV: BBC Ukraine editor: There is no safe place any more FROM MOSCOW: Shock and support in Russian capital IN MAPS: How Russia carried out the invasion On his way into Thursday nights summit the Polish prime minister voiced deep frustration that tougher sanctions hadnt been imposed earlier on Moscow. Enough of this cheap talking snapped Mateusz Morawiecki. Europe continues buying so much Russian oil and gas he said. And he Vladimir Putin] is turning it into aggression invasion. He\s destabilising all of Europe. But other EU leaders pulled in a different direction. True all 27 of them unanimously agreed to an unprecedented sanctions package described by the European Council president as massive and painful against Russia. The package targets more sectors of the Russian economy including the transport and energy sectors (with a ban on exports from Europe that Russia depends on to refine its oil for sale) as well as the financial sector and more individuals close to the Kremlin. EU leaders also agreed to slap sanctions on Belarus a key Putin ally. But the sanctions and counter-sanctions threatened by Russia will hit European economies too. Some more than others making them wary. Germany and Italy - so reliant on Russian gas supplies and business ties - urged the EU to hold back on the toughest sanctions of all for now like limiting oil and gas imports and ejecting Russia from the Swift international payment system. Berlin and Rome argue it\s wiser to keep those nuclear measures as they\re known up the EU\s sleeve in case the situation worsens in Ukraine. Their critics accuse them of self-interest in a time of international crisis. Emotional but dignified Hungary Romania and Poland meanwhile voiced other concerns at the summit. Direct neighbours of Ukraine they worry theyll find themselves on the front line of a new migration crisis should Ukrainians try to flee the hostilities in large numbers. Brussels says its working both on contingency plans to help refugees and to compensate EU countries worst hit by sanctions and resulting further spiralling energy prices. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption People arriving from Kyiv sheltered inside a railway station in Poland on Thursday The message the EU hoped to transmit on Thursday was one of unity: externally with warnings to Russia and assurances of solidarity to Ukraine. EU leaders heard what\s described as an emotional but dignified address by Ukraine\s president via video conference. But also internally - to show all member states that theyre in this crisis together. For the long haul. Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Russia Vladimir Putin European Union Ukraine]

Fast fashion: European Union reveals fast fashion crackdown,Fast fashion could be a thing of the past under plans to make clothing worn in the EU more sustainable.,Fast fashion: European Union reveals fast fashion crackdown By Helen Briggs Environment correspondent Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Climate change IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Fashion production has a big impact on climate Clothes furniture and smartphones sold in Europe must be longer-lasting and easier to repair under new rules proposed by the European Union. The strategy launched on Wednesday targets products at every stage of use including design repair and recycling. The initiative aims to boost the market for sustainably made textiles. It also says it will crack down on companies misleading consumers with false environmental claims or greenwashing. Manufacturers will have to ensure their clothes are eco-friendly and hard-wearing. And consumers will be given more information on how to reuse repair and recycle their clothes. Iona Popescu of environmental NGO the Environmental Coalition on Standards said the rules were designed to bring in longer-lasting products that could be used multiple times rather than worn a few times then thrown away. The Commission seeks to put a halt on fast fashion by introducing rules on textiles to be used in the European market she said. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption The global fashion industry is estimated to have produced around 2.1 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2018 Its estimated that less than 1% of all clothing worldwide is recycled. What is fast fashion? Can sustainable fashion turn the red carpet green? Could ditching fast fashion make us happier? According to the European Environment Agency clothes use in Europe has on average the fourth highest impact on the environment and climate exceeded only by food housing and transport. For every person in the EU textile consumption requires nine cubic metres of water 400 square metres of land 391kg of raw materials and causes a carbon footprint of about 270kg. In the UK politicians have called on the government to change the law to require fashion retailers to comply with environmental standards. The government rejected most of the Environmental Audit Committees recommendations in 2019 including making clothes producers pay for better clothing collection and recycling but has made textile waste a priority. Tamara Cincik of the think tank for the fashion industry Fashion Roundtable said the textiles strategy could set the tone for future legislation outside of the EU. If expectations of brands in the UK compared to the EU diverge this will hopefully encourage stronger expectations of future UK legislation she said. This is why it is so important for both UK brands and the government to be alert to this strategy as the EU remains our largest and indeed closest trading partner for the textiles and fashion industry. The proposals will now be discussed by the Council and European Parliament.

The newly formed team of eight to 12 experts from Lithuania Croatia Poland Estonia Romania and the Netherlands has committed to help defend Ukraine from cyber-attacks - remotely and on site in the country. An official warned attacks were likely. We can see that cyber-measures are an important part of Russia\s hybrid toolkit the CRRT official said. It comes after the UK and the US blamed Russia for cyber-attacks earlier this month that temporarily took a small number of Ukrainian banking and government websites offline. Why is Putin ordering troops into Ukraine? UK warned to bolster defences against cyber attacks EU wants emergency team for cyber-attacks The Lithuanian Ministry of Defence tweeted: In response to Ukraine request we] are activating a] Lithuanian-led cyber rapid-response team which will help Ukrainian institutions to cope with growing cyber-threats. #StandWithUkraine. CRRTs are a European Union initiative to deepen defence and co-operation between member states. They are said to be equipped with commonly developed cyber-toolkits designed to detect recognise and mitigate cyber-threats. An official said the team was composed of different cyber-expertise such as incident response forensics vulnerability assessment to be able to react to a variety of scenarios. Russia has previously been accused of so-called hybrid warfare combining cyber-attacks with traditional military activity in Georgia and Crimea. Media caption Experts have been warning for years it is a matter of when - rather than if - hackers will kill somebody The EU and Ukraine blamed Russia after thousands of people in multiple cities in Ukraine experienced power cuts in 2015 and 2016 when hackers temporarily shut off electricity substations. The US UK and EU also blamed it for the hugely disruptive NotPetya wiper attack. Experts say about 2000 NotPetya attacks were launched in 2017 mainly aimed at Ukraine but the malicious software spread globally causing billions of dollars of damage to computer systems across Europe Asia and the Americas.

The protocol is the Brexit deal which prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EUs single market for goods. That also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? The EU accepts that is causing difficulties for businesses and in October proposed a package of measures to reduce its practical impacts. In December it published further proposals aimed at guaranteeing the supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The UK wants more far-reaching changes to the protocols operation and governance. The EU official said that the technical talks had made some progress in trying to find ways to reduce the burden of customs paperwork on Northern Ireland businesses. The EU believes it will be possible to reduce the data fields on customs declarations from 80 to 30. The UK believes that the reduction should be greater with traders only needing to use customs codes which would describe goods in high level terms. But the EU says that for the purposes of risk management they need customs codes which give a greater level of detail. The example they give is olive oil - some types of olive oil like extra virgin are clearly for consumption in restaurants or supermarkets. IMAGE SOURCE HENRY NICHOLLS Image caption Liz Truss says a solution must be found to allow focus on external issues like the situation in Eastern Europe But other grades of olive oil are used for food processing - the EU believes a risk assessment needs to be able to draw that distinction which is why they want more detailed codes. There has also been progress on access to UK customs databases - long requested by the EU; their experts have got access and are beginning to understand how they might extract the data they need. However there appears to have been little progress on the issue of agri-food checks on goods moving from GB to NI. Asked if the UK would trigger Article 16 which allows either side to unilaterally decide whether to stop implementing parts of the trade deal Mrs Truss said that she wanted to improve the situation through talks. Article 16 is in the Protocol as a safeguard if things aren\t working as they should she said after the talks. Laser focus Mr Sefcovic told a news conference in Brussels that the intensified negotiations on the protocol had produced neither a breakthrough nor a breakdown. He said hard work would continue with a laser focus on practical solutions. My objective remains the same - to provide Northern Ireland and all stakeholders on the ground with stability predictability and opportunities stemming from the protocol he said. Ultimately this is the only way to protect the hard-earned gains of the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement in all its dimensions while avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland and minimising disruptions caused by Brexit without compromising the integrity of the EU\s single market he added. Northern Irelands first and deputy first ministers normally attend the Joint Committee but those positions are vacant since the Democratic Unionist Partys (DUP) Paul Givan stepped down from the first ministers post. He resigned as part of the DUPs campaign of opposition to the protocol. Sinn Féin Junior Minister Declan Kearney did attend in their absence. Meanwhile the Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi was asked on Monday about the possibility of any future trade deals between the UK and the United States. Ms Pelosi said: Our relationship in trade is dependent on how the Brexit accords are resolved. She added she wanted to see the Good Friday accords honoured and for the] border to remain the way it is. She said she had told Boris Johnson months ago not to expect a bilateral trade agreement with the US if there is an unravelling of the Good Friday accords in relationship to the border.]

Man who sent Marcus Rashford racist Euro 2020 final tweet jailed,"Justin Lee Price tweeted a ""clearly racist"" message to Marcus Rashford after the Euro 2020 final.",Man who sent Marcus Rashford racist Euro 2020 final tweet jailed Published 3 days ago Share IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Rashford was targeted with abuse online after the final and a mural honouring him was also defaced A man who racially abused Marcus Rashford on Twitter after the striker missed a penalty in Englands Euro 2020 final shoot-out defeat has been jailed. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Justin Lee Price sent a clearly racist tweet to the Manchester United player after the loss in July 2021. The 19-year-old\s actions constituted a hate crime a CPS spokesman said. Price of Grandison Gardens Worcester was jailed for six weeks at Kidderminster Magistrates Court. He previously admitted one count of sending a grossly offensive message by a public communication network at a hearing on 17 March. Ruin the game The CPS said Price initially tried to avoid detection by changing his Twitter username after the post was reported. He then denied the offence in his first police interview following his arrest but later admitted posting the tweet when he was questioned by officers a second time. The spokesman said the tweet which included Rashford\s username saw Price swear use a racist slur and claim that his dead nan could have scored that. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Bukayo Saka who missed Englands last penalty also faced abuse online after the final Rashford and fellow players Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were targeted with abuse online in the aftermath of the final. A mural honouring Rashford was also defaced in Manchester before being repainted and covered with messages of hope and support. Speaking after sentencing senior crown prosecutor Mark Johnson said Price had targeted Rashford based on the colour of his skin and his action was clearly racist and a hate crime. Those who racially abuse footballers ruin the game for all he said. I hope this case sends out the message that we will not tolerate racism and offenders will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

Brexit: UK and EU to continue 'intensive' NI protocol talks,"The UK and EU agree on the ""need for progress in the interest of people in Northern Ireland"".",Brexit: UK and EU to continue intensive NI protocol talks By Jayne McCormack BBC News NI political correspondent Published 11 February comments Comments Share Related Topics EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks IMAGE SOURCE SIMON DAWSON / NO10 DOWNING STRE Image caption Liz Truss and Maroš Šefčovič met at Carlton Gardens in London on Friday The UK and EU will hold intensive discussions in the coming days after another round of negotiations between Liz Truss and her EU counterpart Maroš Šefčovič came to an end on Friday. The chief Brexit negotiator previously said fixing the Northern Ireland Protocol was an absolute priority. A joint statement indicated the pair had agreed on the need for progress in the interest of people in NI. They said they will keep in close touch. The UK foreign secretary and EU Commission vice president spoke via video-conference last week but no breakthrough was reached. A meeting of the Joint Committee the formal body overseeing the protocol will happen on 21 February. That will be the first such meeting of the committee in more than six months. The government has insisted it wants to reach a solution urgently after the collapse of the power-sharing executive at Stormont last week. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) withdrew Paul Givan as first minister as part of its ongoing opposition to the Irish Sea border. The party has argued that unless the arrangements are changed political institutions in Northern Ireland cannot continue as normal. Image caption Liz Truss said she wants to work with the EU towards solutions that deliver for people in Northern Ireland Ahead of the meeting Ms Truss said: Fixing the Northern Ireland Protocol is an absolute priority for me. We have a shared responsibility with the EU to work towards solutions as quickly as possible that deliver for the people of Northern Ireland. The protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EUs single market for goods and EU customs rules are enforced at its ports. That arrangement has prevented a hardening of the Irish land border but it means new paperwork and processes when importing goods from Great Britain. Unionist politicians have criticised the arrangements and say the Irish Sea border undermines Northern Irelands position in the UK as well as causing difficulties for some businesses. It is slow-going The fact that a statement is joint would usually be taken as a good sign. But todays readout from the UKs Liz Truss and the EUs Maroš Šefčovič was also very brief - with a good chunk of the word count used up describing the logistics of the meeting rather than its actual substance. Rumours that the UK would use today to make a big new offer have been downplayed by both sides although I am told ideas are always being batted about. Customs is the area where there has been the most progress but it is slow-going. All eyes now turn to the joint committee on 21 February - where senior politicians and representatives will meet in Brussels. It is a moment to take stock and see what if anything can be formally agreed in this period of heightened political sensitivity in Northern Ireland ahead of the assembly elections in May. Greatest threat Speaking after an anti-protocol rally in Dromore County Down on Thursday night DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said it was the single greatest threat to Northern Ireland\s place in the UK in a generation. The presence of trade barriers within our own country has the grave potential to succeed where decades of terrorism failed by driving an irrevocable wedge between Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK Sir Jeffrey said. IMAGE SOURCE PACEMAKER PRESS Image caption Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the EU should act immediately to resolve the problems created by the protocol If the EU really care about political stability in Northern Ireland then they should act immediately to resolve the problems created by the protocol. The rally also featured TUV leader Jim Allister and Ulster Unionist assembly member Robbie Butler alongside Baroness Kate Hoey and former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib. On Thursday former prime minister John Major described the protocol as arguably one of the worst pieces of negotiation we have seen in recent history. It is causing an enormous amount of trouble he said. Whether anyone deliberately misled about that I can\t say - certainly they were mistaken. But it does help if you sign treaties if you understand them before you sign them. IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption Former prime minister John Major described the protocol as arguably one of the worst pieces of negotiation we have seen in recent history On Wednesday Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated his view that the government would trigger a mechanism to override part of the deal if a breakthrough cannot be reached. Article 16 allows either the UK or EU to temporarily suspend the protocol if it is deemed to be causing significant economic societal or environmental difficulties. Givan resignation triggers fresh political crisis Executive return difficult if protocol remains A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Over the past seven months the UK government has been attempting to renegotiate the deal. In July it proposed an arrangement in which goods from Great Britain which are due to stay in Northern Ireland would not be checked and would have minimal paperwork. Goods which are due to move onwards to the Republic of Ireland would be checked at Northern Irelands ports. The EU published its own proposals in October which it said would significantly reduce but not eliminate checks on goods. It has previously said that the easiest way to reduce checks would be for the UK to sign up to a Swiss-style agri-food agreement. That would involve all of the UK following the relevant EU rules something the government has said it could not accept.]

Climate change: EU moves to label nuclear and gas as sustainable despite internal row,"A highly controversial decision to class nuclear and gas power as ""green"" splits EU members.",Climate change: EU moves to label nuclear and gas as sustainable despite internal row Published 2 February Share Related Topics Climate change IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Only some EU members use nuclear power - others are fiercely opposed Nuclear and natural gas energy plants could be counted as green energy under controversial EU plans just unveiled. The European Commission says it has decided that both types of energy can classify as sustainable investment if they meet certain targets. But the move has divided the EU and been fiercely opposed by some members. Austria\s chancellor responded to the news by saying nuclear power is neither green nor sustainable. I cannot understand the decision of the EU Karl Nehammer said. He said he would back his environment minister Leonore Gewessler in pursuing legal action at the European Court of Justice if the plans go ahead. This decision is wrong Ms Gewessler said. The EU Commission today agreed its greenwashing programme for nuclear energy and the fossil fuel] natural gas. Luxembourg has also said it will join in legal action. The EU has set itself a goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050 and the Commission argues that to get there a great deal of private investment is needed. Its proposals are meant to guide investors. 🇱🇺 strongly reaffirms its opposition to the inclusion of #nuclear & fossil #gas in the decision on #EUTaxonomy for sustainable finance of the @EUCommission. We will consider further legal steps together with 🇦🇹. @TimmermansEU @McGuinnessEU @KadriSimson @DieschbourgC @MinFinLux — Claude Turmes (@ClaudeTurmes) February 2 2022 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter Spain too has strongly objected to the idea which was debated for months before being formally proposed on Wednesday. But those objections are balanced by support from nuclear-using nations such as France. Nuclear energy involves fewer carbon emissions but has different safety concerns and requires disposal of dangerous waste. Classifying natural gas as sustainable also has supporters who argue that some countries which still rely on coal for energy - such as Poland - would benefit from incentives to move to a relatively cleaner supply. Germany a powerful country in EU politics relies heavily on gas in its own energy mix though its environment minister Steffi Lemke has criticised the plans. Battle ahead EU officials were keen to stress that the change was not a requirement for any state or company to invest in gas or nuclear. It is instead a highly technical set of rules called the EU Taxonomy about what classifies as sustainable so that private investors can decide where to put funds the commission says. It also regulates what can be said to be environmentally friendly so that climate-conscious investors can make informed decisions. The list is supposed to recognise green projects that make a substantial contribution to at least one of the EU\s environmental goals while not significantly harming any of them. A really simple guide to climate change Greenhouse gas build-up hit new high in 2020 Fossil fuel production set to soar in next decade Commission officials point to the strict limits on what qualifies. For example natural gas generation is under a strict CO2 emissions limit and a requirement to switch to low-carbon gas by 2035. Nuclear power meanwhile must be in countries with clear plans and funding for dealing with nuclear waste. Critics however have accused the EU of so-called greenwashing - precisely what it says its classification system is supposed to avoid. But the decision to label both controversial industries as green is not yet final. In addition to the threat of legal action from Austria and Luxembourg the European Parliament and the council of heads of state have four months to consider the suggestion and object to it. IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption Commissioner Mairead McGuinness argues that every tool to reach climate targets must be used The bar is however relatively high. In order to block the commissions proposed plans either a majority of parliament members or at least 20 of the 27 national leaders are needed. Green parties which together with independents and others form one of the main power blocs in the European Parliament are fiercely campaigning against the plan. But European Commissioner Mairead McGuinness said we need to use all the tools at our disposal to reach the climate-neutral target. Private investment was key she said and the proposals were setting out strict conditions to help mobilise finance to support this transition away from more harmful energy sources like coal.
