Eurovision 2020: James Newman announced as United Kingdom's entry,Singer-songwriter James Newman will represent the United Kingdom with his song My Last Breath.,Eurovision 2020: James Newman announced as United Kingdoms entry By Steve Holden Newsbeat music reporter Published 27 February 2020 comments Comments Share IMAGE SOURCE VICTOR FRANKOWSKI Singer-songwriter James Newman will represent the United Kingdom at this years Eurovision Song Contest. Hell perform My Last Breath at the events final in Rotterdam in The Netherlands on 16 May. Speaking to Radio 1 Newsbeat James hopes his simple memorable and anthemic song will help win votes. James is a successful pop songwriter and has written for acts including Ed Sheeran and Jess Glynne and is the older brother of John Newman. Figure caption Warning: Third party content may contain adverts The UKs looking to improve on 2019s contest when Michael Rices X-Factor style ballad Bigger Than Us finished in last place. It marked the fourth time the UK had come bottom of the table but James says he doesnt feel nervous at that prospect. He feels his song will connect with the audience and says he has a massive opportunity to get my song out to the world in such a big way. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption James has co-written song for pop acts such as Ed Sheeran Little Mix and Louis Tomlinson James is signed to record label BMG who the BBC have worked with to select and produce this years entry. After he was approached James says he had a little think before saying yes but decided Eurovision was a celebration of music. While the United Kingdom is still one of the most successful countries in the 63-year history of the contest (five wins in total) its seen little success since its last win in 1997. Whilst many still associate the event with camp cheese and tackiness the modern day contest is a slick production where many countries send their best acts. Eurovision is the worlds largest live music event with organisers claiming the 2019 edition was seen by 182 million viewers across 40 markets. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Duncan Laurence won the 2019 contest for the Netherlands with his stirring ballad Arcade. Since I was a little kid I\ve always wanted to be an artist and performer myself says James. It just feels like the right time to start putting songs out. He says he\s lucky to have a brother like John (Newman) who\s used to performing in front of thousands of people but with a cheeky smile he reckons it\s time to show everyone who the actual good singer is. My Last Breath was written in Scotland when he was staying near a loch with his mates (and fellow songwriters) Ed Drewett Iain James and Adam Argyle. We were jumping in the loch every morning. This was January. It was freezing. The song was inspired by a documentary about a diver in the North Sea who has to be saved after getting cut off from the rest of his crew and the video features Dutch cold water swimmer Wim Hof. It got us thinking about what you would for other people. Iain James already has Eurovision credentials co-writing Azerbaijans 2011 winning entry Running Scared. James Newman also has Eurovision history himself after writing Irelands 2017 entry - but it didnt qualify for the final. There was a weird moment when Greg James played the UKs Eurovision song on BBC Radio 1. There it was sandwiched between tracks by Harry Styles and Dua Lipa and... it didnt sound like his show had been hacked. Thats down to the pedigree of James Newman and his co-writers who have written hits for some of the UKs biggest pop exports of the last decade. My Last Breath ticks all the Eurovision boxes: It\s a mid-tempo banger with a Coldplay-style woah-oh hook and a lyric about undying love. Granted the central metaphor is weirdly macabre (it concerns two scuba divers running out of air) but somehow that makes it more memorable. It doesnt feel like a winner but nor does it feel like an embarrassment. And that at least is progress. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption James won a Brit Award for co-writing Waiting All Night performed by Rudimental and Ella Eyre Over the past decade the BBC has tried two strategies for Eurovision with neither providing amazing results. From 2011 to 2015 the act was internally selected by the BBC with Blues I Can getting the best result. It placed 11th out of 25 in 2011. From 2016 to 2019 the act was selected with a public vote. Of those Lucie Jones 2017 ballad Ill Never Give Up On You placed 15th. The last time the UK actually got into the Eurovision final top ten was in 2009 when Jade Ewen performed the Andrew Lloyd Webber-penned track Its My Time and came fifth. This year the United Kingdoms strategy has changed once again with the BBC essentially giving record label BMG free rein to choose the act and curate the performance. No matter what happens when the votes start rolling in James says it\s an amazing thing to be singing something you love in front of all those people.

'More trust' between Isle of Man and United Kingdom,"There will be ""more trust"" between the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom government, according to the minister of state at the Ministry of Justice.",More trust between Isle of Man and United Kingdom Published 27 May 2011 Share Image caption Lord McNally and the Chief Minister of the Isle of Man look forward to a more trusting relationship There will be more trust between the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom government according to the minister of state at the Ministry of Justice. Lord McNally has been visiting the Isle of Man for the first time since his appointment last year. He said it was taking too long for the UK to process Manx legislation. He added: It is important we have a more mature relationship and trust Isle of Man ministerial judgement rather than thinking Whitehall knows best. Lord McNally who has special responsibility for the crown dependencies admitted Whitehall seemed to have a much more streamlined approach to processing Scottish legislation something he has committed to look at on his return to the UK. He confirmed there will be a more direct relationship between Isle of Man ministers and UK departments with direct responsibility. I would hope it isn\t just a relationship which is used when there is a problem but with regular meetings which allow us to anticipate and solve problems before they have begun.]

The Victorian market beat off opposition from internationally-famous London markets Spitalfields Billingsgate and Borough. St Georges owned and operated by Belfast City Council was awarded the title by the National Association of British Market Authorities (NABMA). It houses 170 traders six shops and a restaurant and sustains 385 jobs. Cllr Deirdre Hargey is chairwoman of the councils development committee which oversees St Georges Market. Fiercely proud She described the award as a fantastic and well-deserved honour. We in the council are fiercely proud of the market and it is great news for us to see it recognised in this way by our peers in the markets industry she said. I would like to pay tribute to the market staff for all their hard work and in particular to the traders whose dedication to St George\s is the key to its continuing success. St Georges opens on Friday Saturday and Sunday and attracts about 600000 visitors a year. The council estimates that the market benefits the Belfast economy by about £15m each year. NABMA is the trade body which represents local authority-operated markets across the UK.]

A United Kingdom: The interracial marriage that made front page news,Amma Asante on bringing to the big screen the story of an African prince's controversial marriage to a white English woman in the 1940s.,A United Kingdom: The interracial marriage that made front page news By Tim Masters Entertainment correspondent in Toronto Published 17 September 2016 Share IMAGE SOURCE PATHE INTERNATIONAL Image caption A United Kingdom stars David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike Before she began working on her new film A United Kingdom Amma Asante had never heard of Seretse Khama. Now shes bringing his story to the big screen and hopes it will illuminate a seemingly forgotten part of British post-war history. In 1947 Seretse Khama an African prince training to be a lawyer in London met and fell in love with Ruth Williams an English bank clerk. But their interracial relationship and plans to wed and return to Seretses native Bechuanaland (modern Botswana) was greeted by fierce family and political opposition. Media caption Witness: Seretse and Ruth We absolutely admit that none of us knew about this story before it came to us in the form of this project says the film\s director Amma Asante. Ten years ago financiers were saying we don\t make period projects about unknown people - they wanted Mozarts and Churchills and people that you knew about. But that\s been changing over the last few years and film is being allowed to expose stories that people haven\t heard of and audiences are proving that that interests them. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Amma Asante with David Oyelowo The project was brought to Asante by David Oyelowo who plays Seretse in A United Kingdom opposite Rosamund Pike as Ruth. Introducing the film to the audience at the Toronto International Film Festival where it had its world premiere Asante described Seretse and Ruth as people who held onto life with both hands. The film she added showed the fall out that happened when they fell in love. Asante expands on the subject when we meet in a Toronto bar the following day. Someone described Seretse and Ruth as the Burton and Taylor of their time she laughs. She was this fashionable creature in these little black suits and he had this trilby hat. They were front page news. Based on Susan Williams book Colour Bar A United Kingdom portrays how opposition to Seretse and Ruths marriage went much wider than their immediate families. The South African government - about to introduce apartheid - could not tolerate the idea of an interracial couple ruling a neighbouring country. It pressured Britain to stop the union by threatening to cut off the supplies of the uranium and gold Britain needed for its nuclear programme and to rebuild its post-war economy. Highly politicised Asante who grew up in south London as the child of Ghanaian immigrants welcomes the number of other films on this years festival circuit - such as The Birth of a Nation and Loving - that examine racial prejudice from a historical perspective. We are in highly politicised times she says. America is just coming out of a period where it had its first black president and it might be about to vote in its first woman president. Britain just voted itself out of Europe. Some people said it had nothing to do with xenophobia some people say it did. In these highly politicised times you get polarisation. There is very little in the middle. At that time the job of the film-maker is to reflect society and the conversations that are going on. A really tangible way to explore politics is through race. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption David Oyelowo greets fans on the red carpet at the world premiere in Toronto which was also attended by Seretses grandson It was important to Asante that the African scenes were filmed in Botswana. She used some of the actual locations associated with Seretse and Ruth such as the house where they first lived. We had to put the house back together literally. It was a derelict shell she recalls. We recreated the looks of the rooms through old photographs. The hospital in the scene where Ruth gives birth to their baby is the actual hospital where Seretse was born. How well is the story known in Botswana? Not as well as I thought says Asante. But I\m going to get lashed on Twitter from people saying \you didn\t get this right you didn\t get that right\. But in the way that Asante\s previous film] Belle is now taught in schools I hope this will also make a difference too across Africa. Seretse died in 1980 having been Botswanas first president since 1966. Ruth who had been the First Lady of Botswana until her husbands death died in 2002. As our interview comes to an end Asante reveals that Seretses grandson had attended the premiere the previous night. Furthermore Seretses son Ian Khama is now the fourth elected president of Botswana. We were in conversation with the president while we were making the film as well as many family members says Asante. They certainly didn\t tell us the kind of film to make. She recalls how President Khama arrived in his helicopter while they were filming in a village. I remember him looking out of the corner of his eye at Rosamund and David and saying \It\s really weird to see your parents coming back to life\. A United Kingdom opens in the UK on 25 November and will open the London Film Festival on 5 October. The Toronto International Film Festival runs until 18 September.

Your view: Olympic torch to tour the United Kingdom,"As the Olympic flame is officially handed to the UK, Newsbeat asks whether people think it will have an impact.",Your view: Olympic torch to tour the United Kingdom By Amy Gladwell Newsbeat reporter in Torbay Published 18 May 2012 Share IMAGE SOURCE AP As the Olympic flame arrives in the UK Newsbeats been finding out whether people think itll have an impact. David Beckham will fly the torch into Cornwall on Friday evening (18 May) after a handing over ceremony was held in the Greek capital Athens. The torch will then start a 70-day relay around the UK before arriving at Londons Olympic Stadium in Stratford at the opening ceremony on 27 July. It will be carried 8000 miles by the same number of people. Newsbeats been to south Devon where Radio 1 is holding a dance party for 8000 people to celebrate the torch arriving. Radio 1 Starts the Summer... Live in Torbay will see DJs like Example and Eric Prydz perform on Saturday as well as Annie Mac and Pete Tong. Naomi Farrell 17 Image caption Naomi (right) with friend Natalie We are all more interested in the fact Radio 1 has come down here said Naomi. People are not really bothered at what it has actually come for. They are more bothered about the music and everything. Zoe Hart 17 Image caption Zoe (right) with her friend Tessa I couldn\t care less. It\s just a big torch said Zoe. The Radio 1 thing I am game for but the whole torch thing doesn\t sound appealing to me. I just don\t understand the whole Olympic thing really why it\s such a massive deal. Curtis Clark 17 Image caption Curtis with his friends Savannah and Nirvana One of my mates is being a torch runner said Curtis. People from all areas get to celebrate the Olympics and they don\t actually have to be in London so it\s all good. On Newsbeats Facebook page Jared Zidane said: I know my train will be delayed by the Olympic torch in a few weeks. I do care about that. But Lisa Shaw is more enthusiastic: Extremely excited and hoping to see the torch on its way through Lincolnshire! David Barker disagreed: All the money they have spent on the Olympics could have been put to better things like the NHS and the army. This place is so messed up.]

NI election 2022: Doug Beattie says 'no united Ireland in children's lifetime',The Ulster Unionist Party leader launches his party's manifesto at HMS Caroline in Belfast.,NI election 2022: Doug Beattie says no united Ireland in childrens lifetime By Gareth Gordon BBC News NI Political Correspondent Published 5 days ago Share Related Topics NI election 2022 IMAGE SOURCE PACEMAKER The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader says there will be no united Ireland in his childrens lifetime. Launching his party\s assembly election manifesto Doug Beattie said the NI Protocol would not lead to fundamental constitutional change regardless of what others are saying. Instead the issues caused by it can and will be dealt with. Mr Beatties office was attacked after he said his party would not attend future anti-protocol rallies. The party\s 40-page manifesto could be described as protocol light with more concentration on other issues. There are only two pages on the protocol compared with seven on health and six on communities. In an unusual launch on the dock beside former warship HMS Caroline Mr Beattie told his partys candidates and the media that they would not be using the protocol as an election slogan. Regardless of what others are saying there will be no fundamental change in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom he said. Issues arise - the protocol can and will be dealt with. So instead of using the protocol as an election slogan let\s get to work. Real work to get the issues dealt with. There will be no united Ireland in my lifetime there will be no united Ireland in my children\s lifetime. If you believe that as a fundamental truth and I believe that as a fundamental truth then we can set it aside in order to concentrate on the issues affecting the daily lives of our people who live here work here or visit here. IMAGE SOURCE PACEMAKER Image caption Health Minister Robin Swann also spoke at the manifesto launch Of course I know some will disagree. But my belief is strong and I am committed to work with them in order to make Northern Ireland work. So I make an appeal to all of those who believe in Northern Ireland and its long term future within the United Kingdom. Most important election Appealing to young people to come out to vote as their civic duty he said he wanted people to see that there is a pro-union party that has a positive vision for the future. On the protocol the manifesto calls for common sense alternatives. Regarding health the party wants the day-to-day running of the service transferred to a Northern Ireland health and social care chief executive. When it comes to education the party wants a single system replacing the current controlled and maintained sectors. Change needed to Stormont system says UUP leader It also wants a ban on the practice of gay conversion therapy. East Belfast candidate Lauren Kerr told the launch the border is not on the ballot paper adding this is the most important election the UUP which was formed almost 120 years ago has ever fought. It currently holds 10 seats and is fielding 27 candidates.]

His predecessors ruled Dahomey which was one of the most powerful kingdoms in West Africa before the colonial era. The king was reported to have been in his nineties though his exact age has not been confirmed. He was last seen in public in November at a ceremony to mark the return by France of 26 royal treasures stolen by French troops in the 19th Century. They included statues decorative palace doors and two royal thrones. Reports of the royals death began circulating last Saturday but the news was confirmed on Thursday AFP news agency says. The monarchy is in mourning. The king... returned to his ancestors on Friday 17 December Dako Kpogbemambou Vovoweyenonsin a dignitary from the kingdom is quoted by AFP as saying. This morning we went to the palace where the bad news was announced. I am completely devastated. Sagbadjou Glèlè ascended to the throne in January 2019 six months after the death of his predecessor Dadah Dedjalagni Agoli-Agbo who had reigned for 30 years. Dahomey of which Abomey was a key part was founded in the 1600s. Its territory was incorporated into a French colony in 1904 and is now included in modern-day Benin. It conquered key cities on the Atlantic coast and sold slaves to European traders in exchange for guns gunpowder and alcohol. Women occupied powerful positions in the kingdom and there was an all-female military regiment named by Westerners as the Dahomey Amazons.]
