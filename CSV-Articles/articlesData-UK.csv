UK economic growth slows sharply in February,A sharp fall in car and computer production weighed on the UK's economic expansion.,UK economic growth slows sharply in February Published 1 day ago comments Comments Share IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES The UKs economic growth slowed in February following a sharp fall in the production of cars and computer goods. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy expanded by 0.1% compared with 0.8% in January. The fall in manufacturing was off-set by growth in the services sector including areas such as tourism and travel. The ONS also said that the UK economy is 1.5% above its pre-coronavirus pandemic level in February 2020. Economists had been expecting gross domestic product (GDP) - which measures activity in services construction and industrial production - to grow by 0.3% in February following the lifting of most Covid restrictions in England at the end of January. The pace of the recovery was already going to slow once the post-Omicron bounce faded and the squeeze on household real incomes intensified said Ruth Gregory senior UK economist at Capital Economics. But we hadn\t expected it to slow so much so soon. Alpesh Paleja lead economist at the CBI a business lobby group said: Near-term challenges to the outlook have ramped up since with a growing cost-of-living crunch set to weigh on growth he said. Businesses are also grappling with headwinds from the Ukraine conflict which is exacerbating cost pressures and supply chain disruption. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he welcomed February\s growth figures. He said: Russia\s invasion of Ukraine is creating additional economic uncertainty here in the UK but it is right that we are responding robustly against Putin\s unprovoked invasion. Semiconductor shortage The ONS said the fall in industrial production was due to a 5.4% drop in the manufacture of transport equipment driven entirely by the fall in manufacture of cars. It added that production of computer and electronic products had fallen in February. Barret Kupelian senior economist at the accountancy firm PwC UK said: This is an area other European economies have also been struggling with because of the semiconductor shortage. Manufacturing is also likely to face headwinds due to high energy prices as it consumes above average energy per unit of GDP and we will see this reflected in future data releases. The construction sector also contracted but at a slower rate than production industries. Capital Economics said the fall was in part driven by Storm Eunice Dudley and Franklin resulting in construction projects being delayed. The services sector provided the only bright spot in the data as post-Omicron spending on leisure continued with growth in accommodation as well as travel agencies and tour operators. Mr Kupelian said growth momentum shifted towards the sectors of the economy which were hardest hit during the pandemic including accommodation and food services activities and arts entertainment and recreation. He said: We expect that there is still more growth to come from these sectors.]
SKA: UK to build software brain for giant radio telescope,The Square Kilometre Array's software will control hundreds of dishes and thousands of antennas.,SKA: UK to build software brain for giant radio telescope Jonathan Amos Science correspondent @BBCAmos on Twitter Published 1 day ago comments Comments Share IMAGE SOURCE SKAO Image caption SKA artwork: The telescope is being built across two continents A group of UK institutions is going to build a prototype brain to control the world\s biggest radio telescope. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will initially comprise 197 dishes and 130000 antennas spread across South Africa and Australia. All will be linked and need to work in perfect harmony. The software now being developed for the purpose will be trialled on a small subset of the infrastructure before being rolled out across the network. The SKA is an immense computing challenge says Dr Chris Pearson astronomy group leader at RAL Space based on the Harwell Campus in Oxfordshire. We\re talking something like 600 petabytes (600 million gigabytes) per year of data coming out of the SKA to be delivered to astronomers worldwide he told BBC News. So it\s a scaling problem it\s a processing problem it\s a data transfer problem. A $10bn machine in search of the end of darkness Astronomers stand up to big satellite networks Single star detected at record-breaking distance IMAGE SOURCE ICRAR-CURTIN Image caption Prototype hardware: Low-frequency antennas will be positioned in Australia The SKA is one of the grand scientific projects of the 21st Century and will join a series of next-generation telescopes coming online this decade. This includes the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope and the super-sized European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) which will have an optical primary mirror 39m in diameter. The SKAs resolution and sensitivity at radio wavelengths allied to that prodigious computing support will enable astronomers to address some of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics today. How did the first stars come to shine in the Universe? What exactly is dark energy - the mysterious form of energy that appears to be driving the cosmos apart at an accelerating rate? And even the most basic question of all - are we alone? The SKA\s unprecedented sensitivity would pick up any extra-terrestrial transmissions. The international organisation behind the SKA gave the formal go last year to begin construction of the array - a task that will take most of this decade. The UK government through the Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC) is the largest contributor to the SKA organisation and currently has a commitment to support 15% of the total cost of construction and the initial operations from 2021 to 2030. IMAGE SOURCE ESO Image caption Artwork: The SKA will complement a new wave of super telescope such as the E-ELT As part of this commitment the STFC released £15m on Monday to fund the arrays software development. The money will go to support work at the universities of Oxford Cambridge and Manchester as well at STFC labs at Harwell Daresbury and Edinburgh. The software will tell the telescope where to look on the sky diagnose any issues and translate the telescopes signals into useable data from which discoveries can be made. This would be straightforward if it were one dish or one antenna but the system must work in unison across the thousands of individual components of the array. We will start small said Dr Pearson. The software that we produce will work first on four radio dishes in South Africa. And if you\re talking about those small antennas in Australia it will work on six stations (of 256 antennas) in the first instance. And then we have to scale in a smart way. We can\t do it linearly as the number of dishes and antennas increases or it will become impossible. This first prototype brain is expected to be up and running in 2024.

Rishi Sunak's wife to pay UK tax on overseas income,Akshata Murty has previously not paid UK tax on shares worth £700m in an Indian tech company.,Rishi Sunaks wife to pay UK tax on overseas income By Simon Jack Business editor Published 3 days ago Share IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Chancellor Rishi Sunaks wife Akshata Murty has said she will pay UK taxes on her overseas income following a row over her non-domicile status. She owns £700m in shares of the Indian IT giant Infosys founded by her father from which she received £11.6m in dividend income last year. As a non-domiciled (non-dom) UK resident she is not required by law to pay UK taxes on her overseas income. But she told the BBC she did not want to be a distraction for her husband. Her decision to change her tax arrangements follows accusations of hypocrisy against the chancellor with opposition parties saying Mr Sunaks family is benefiting at a time when the cost of living is going up. The BBC estimates Ms Murty would have avoided £2.1m a year in UK tax through her non-dom status. Ms Murty said her tax arrangements had been entirely legal but added: It has become clear that many do not feel it is compatible with my husband\s role as chancellor. I understand and appreciate the British sense of fairness and I do not wish my tax status to be a distraction for my husband or to affect my family. A non-dom is someone who lives in the UK but declares their permanent home to be in another country. Sunak held US green card until last year Smearing my wife to get at me is awful says Sunak Whatever happened to Sunaks political honeymoon? Mr Sunak has accused political opponents of smearing his wife to get at him. He has also said she is entitled to use the non-dom arrangement as she is an Indian citizen and plans to move back to her home country in the future to care for her parents. Ms Murty will retain her Indian citizenship and her non-dom status which as the BBC revealed allows her family to avoid paying inheritance tax in the UK - which at current valuation could amount to £280m. On Thursday it emerged she pays £30000 a year to maintain her non-dom status. In her statement Ms Murty also said she would now be paying UK tax on all my worldwide income including dividends and capital gains wherever in the world that income arises. I do this because I want to not because the rules require me to. These new arrangements will begin immediately and will also be applied to the tax year just finished (2021-22) she added. Labour MP Louise Haigh said Mr Sunak had not been transparent. The shadow transport secretary said: It is clear that was legal. I think the question many people will be asking is whether it was ethical and whether it was right that the Chancellor of the Exchequer whilst piling on 15 separate tax rises to the British public was benefiting from a tax scheme that allowed his household to pay significantly less to the tune of potentially tens of millions of pounds. Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine called on the Sunak household to backdate the taxes in full adding: Doing something just because you\ve been found out isn\t good enough. While one former cabinet minister said he had mild sympathy for Mr Sunak as he had been subjected to a nasty ad hominem attack he added that every leadership candidate declared or otherwise should expect this. He was naïve if he thought families were off-limits for attacks. His view was that the tax row could be as toxic for the chancellor as partygate has been for Mr Johnson. It was all about a disconnect with ordinary voters. They could not hold a childrens birthday party during lockdown but boozy get-togethers were apparently held at the heart of government. Similarly their taxes were being put up by the chancellor while his wife did not pay UK tax on some of her own earnings. Read Iains full analysis here. Speaking to the Sun newspaper Mr Sunak said it was unfair to attack his wife as she was a private citizen adding: I\m an elected politician. So I know what I signed up for. It comes on the same day it was revealed that the couple retained their rights to live and work in the US by having green cards - which requires holders to consider America their permanent home - for more than a year after Mr Sunak became chancellor in 2020. He returned his green card in October last year ahead of his first US trip as a UK government minister. Asked about the issue at a White House daily media briefing press secretary Jen Psaki said it was a matter for other government departments and declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Mr Sunak said he had filed US tax returns while he held his green card in full compliance with the law. Meanwhile No 10 has rejected newspaper reports that its staff are leaking damaging stories about Mr Sunak to the media. And Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters at a Downing Street news conference: If there are such briefings they are not coming from us in No 10 and heaven knows where they are coming from. I think that Rishi is doing an absolutely outstanding job. What is a non-dom? A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home or domicile outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority non-doms have to provide evidence about their background lifestyle and future intentions such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Those who have the status must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time. Ms Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father the billionaire Narayana Murty. Read more here. Related Topics UK taxes Infosys Rishi Sunak]

Akshata Murty: Chancellor's wife could save £280m in UK tax,A tax agreement between the UK and India could offer significant savings on Ms Murty’s inheritance tax bill.,Akshata Murty: Chancellors wife could save £280m in UK tax By Simon Jack Business editor Published 3 days ago Share IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Rishi Sunak has argued it is wrong for people to criticise his wife Akshata Murty Chancellor Rishi Sunaks wife could save herself £280m in UK tax thanks to a loophole created by a treaty between the UK and India dating from the 1950s. Akshata Murty has non-dom status meaning she does not have to pay UK tax on income earned abroad. Non-dom status wears off after 15 years and the person is subject to all tax requirements of a UK citizen - including on their estate. But there is an exception for Indian citizens around inheritance tax. A technicality means that even if Ms Murty agrees to pay UK taxes on her worldwide income but retains her non-dom status she can still benefit from a provision in a 1956 treaty that was designed to stop Indian citizens being double-taxed on their estates in the UK and India. Ms Murty earns money from shares in an Indian software giant founded by her billionaire father. India abolished inheritance tax in the 1980s but this tax exemption was never revoked. So Ms Murty could have her estate taxed there at zero upon her death rather than in the UK at 40% - saving £280m on her £700m stake in the company founded by her father. Like her current reduced tax rate on her worldwide income - this would be perfectly legal and HMT Treasury has said that the chancellor provided all relevant information on his interests when he became a minister. Smearing my wife to get at me is awful says Sunak Sunak under pressure over wifes non-dom status Firm part-owned by Sunaks wife closing Russia office Nevertheless the very significant sums Ms Murty could have saved up to now - and may save in the future - pose some awkward questions for Rishi Sunak. As Chancellor Rishi Sunak has ultimate oversight of all fiscal matters in the UK. That includes regular reviews of the non-dom rules. Reviewing rules which directly affect the financial arrangements of his own family members seems uncomfortable at best a direct conflict of interest at worst. Others including the chancellors political opponents have suggested that Mr Sunak should move his power over non-dom policy to another department. On reported dividends of £11.5m from £700m worth of shares Ms Murty would have paid tax at 39.5% as a UK citizen which works out as £4.5m. As an Indian citizen the Indian government would tax dividends at 20% (a withholding tax). The UK government would tax the difference between that and the UK rate or 19.5%. So Ms Murty saves £2.1m per year through her non-dom status. She has also reportedly received income from companies based in Mauritius which enjoys a more favourable tax treaty with India where the Indian government withholds just 15% of dividend income from Indian companies. It is not known whether Murty holds these shares through a company based in a Mauritius or any other tax haven. Labour party leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for full transparency from the chancellor over his family\s finances. A spokesperson for HM Treasury said: The chancellor provided a full list of all relevant interests when he first became a Minister in 2018 as required by the Ministerial Code. The Independent Adviser on Ministers\ Interests has confirmed that they are completely satisfied with the steps the Chancellor has taken to meet the requirements of the Code. To be clear Akshata Murty is not accused of any wrongdoing whatsoever. But someone with preferential tax status living in Number 11 Downing Street does pose uncomfortable questions for the other adult resident.]
How do the UK's schemes for Ukrainian refugees work?,How is the government helping Ukrainian refugees come to the UK?,How do the UKs schemes for Ukrainian refugees work? By Reality Check BBC News Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS The UK has been widely criticised for not allowing as many Ukrainian refugees to enter as some other European states. What are the schemes? Family visa scheme The family visa scheme is for Ukrainians with a family member in the UK. That family member must have British nationality indefinite leave to remain settled status or proof of permanent residence. It was launched at the beginning of March and extended after criticism that it excluded some close family members. Ukrainian refugees are advised to apply at a Visa Application Centre (VAC) in countries including Poland Romania Hungary and Moldova. They need to provide biometric information such as fingerprints. Applications from refugees with a Ukrainian passport can be made online with biometric information provided after arrival in the UK. As of 7 April the UK had issued 28500 visas under this scheme from 36300 applications. However only 10800 have arrived in the UK under this scheme so far. Ukrainian refugee family thwarted by paperwork Sponsorship scheme The Homes for Ukraine scheme lets people in the UK host Ukrainians refugees who are known to them but who do not have family ties here. It was launched on 14 March and more than 100000 people and organisations signed up within the first day. Under the scheme people are asked to offer Ukrainians a rent-free space in their home or a separate residence for at least six months. They will not be expected to provide food and living expenses but can choose to do so. Those offering to host a refugee will be vetted by the government and Ukrainian applicants will undergo security checks. Each household housing a refugee will be offered £350 a month tax-free for up to 12 months. Local authorities will also receive £10500 in extra funding per refugee for support services with more for children of school age. However some families who have applied to be sponsors have complained that the system is overly complicated. Government figures show that as of 7 April 12500 sponsorship visas had been issued from 43600 applications. However only 1200 refugees have arrived in the UK so far under the sponsorship visas. How to sponsor Ukrainian refugees and offer them a UK home 2700 visas issued through Homes for Ukraine Homes for Ukraine: Its sad slow and frustrating Why has the UK governments response been criticised? The Home Office has been accused of a chaotic and overly-bureaucratic response. EU countries are allowing Ukrainian refugees in for up to three years without a visa and more than four million people have fled to neighbouring countries since the Russian invasion. Poland has taken more than 2.5 million refugees and Romania more than 650000. As of 7 April 40900 UK visas had been issued in total but only 12000 have reached the UK so far. On 8 April Home Secretary Priti Patel apologised with frustration for visa delays. On 26 February Home Office minister Kevin Foster was widely criticised after highlighting the governments Seasonal Worker visa which allows people to apply to come to the UK to pick fruit and vegetables. His tweet was subsequently deleted. There have been complaints that the UK visa process is too complicated - one British man told the BBC it had taken 72 hours to get a visa for his Ukrainian step-daughter who had fled to Romania. There have also been reports of refugees who have got as far as Calais before being turned away by Border Force officials for not having the right paperwork. Heartless or doing its best to help refugees? UK in crisis mode On 7 March Home Secretary Priti Patel told MPs we have set up a bespoke VAC en route to Calais. But the Home Office did not confirm that this was the case. The government then opened a VAC in Lille on 10 March - around 70 miles away from Calais. The Home Office said it would deal with a limited number of cases - referred to it by Border Force officials - and advised applicants not to travel there. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Why have so few visas been issued by the government so far? In addition to the lengthy paperwork refugees must submit to obtain both types of visas government guidance for the Homes for Ukraine scheme states that applicants will be subject to a range of checks. These can include: a visit from local authorities to ensure that properties are fit for purpose basic DBS check if hosts are sponsoring adults enhanced DBS check if hosts are sponsoring children under 18 or vulnerable adults. It is likely that the vetting process will exacerbate what already seems to be a long and complex visa application process. Will the UK lift visa rules for Ukrainian refugees? The government has faced pressure - including from some Conservative MPs - to issue emergency visas or lift visa requirements altogether for Ukrainian refugees. Home Secretary Priti Patel has ruled this out insisting that security and biometric checks were vital to keep British citizens safe. The government also says that some people in Calais claiming to be Ukrainians have presented false documents. Boris Johnson has defended the current visa rules saying: People want us to be generous but also careful. He has also repeatedly talked about the government\s proud record on refugees since 2015 telling MPs we\ve done more to resettle vulnerable people than any other European country since 2015. However this only refers to one specific category - resettled refugees. Other European countries have taken in larger numbers of refugees in general.

Homes for Ukraine: Family's 'torturous' wait for a UK visa,Host Joanne Turner and refugee Iryna fear it may be weeks before her family can come to the UK.,Homes for Ukraine: Familys torturous wait for a UK visa By Joseph Lee BBC News Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE ELENA A British woman said she is expecting a torturous weeks-long wait before the Ukrainian refugee family she is sponsoring receives visas to travel. Joanne Turner from Norwich said the refugees made their application as soon as the scheme opened on 18 March. But three weeks on Iryna her daughter Sofia and her mother Elena are still stuck sharing a flat with a Polish family in Krakow. The feeling of uncertainty is the most frustrating says Irina. A government spokesperson said it had launched one of the fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history following the invasion. But as Home Secretary Priti Patel apologised for visa delays Joanne told BBC Radio 4\s Today programme that it felt as if their application was getting nowhere really. Homes for Ukraine: Its sad slow and frustrating Patel apologises for Ukraine refugee visa delays Man buys £100k house for Ukrainian refugee family She said they had made the application as soon as the lines were first open and had prepared their home passing checks to ensure they had suitable accommodation. We had hoped that in a few days Iryna and her mum Elena and her little girl Sofia would be with us in Norwich she said. Everything is ready. But it was impossible to get a timeframe from the authorities Joanne said describing the responses from the government helpline as pretty crazy stuff. We\ve been trying everything. There\s a government helpline that you can get through to. I called them and they basically said we can\t give you any information she said. They were basically saying we are told to say nothing we can\t give any information on the status of the application. Joanne said the process is frustrating for her but for Iryna and her family and all the other families that are trying to get to the UK it\s torturous really. She told the BBC that they had shared photos of their house and their dog an Irish setter called Rathlin with the family as they waited. Her little girl just wants to meet our dog said Joanne. IMAGE SOURCE JOANNE TURNER In the meantime Iryna and her family are sharing an apartment in Krakow with a Polish family. She said the family have been kind but have been asking her how long she needs to stay and she doesnt know the answer. We expected to stay here a few days until all the documents were going to be ready. But it seems the time is going to be prolonged for a few weeks not a couple of days Iryna said. The feeling of uncertainty is the most frustrating because if we knew how long it\s going to be - a few more days a few more weeks... Nobody is able to provide you with exact information about the timing. She said her daughter is seven and has now missed more than a month of school since the invasion began. They could not make any permanent arrangements in Poland because the country which has seen more than 2.5 million cross the border since Russia attacked is overloaded with other Ukrainian refugees Iryna said. But she said she was grateful for the proactive efforts of British people and said she hoped it would be possible to find shelter in a few days. The government spokesperson added: In just four weeks over 40000 visas have been issued so people can rebuild their lives in the UK through the Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine. We are continuing to speed up visa processing across both schemes including boosting caseworkers and simplifying the forms and we expect thousands more to come through these uncapped routes.]

With many Ukrainian regions banning sales of alcohol after the Russian invasion 44 days ago Kyiv-based Varvar Brew was left with unsold stock. Hertfordshire-based beer wholesaler Euroboozer arranged for the equivalent of 45000 pints to be driven to the UK. Pubs and shops around the country will sell the beers with hundreds of drinks already pre-ordered by customers. Bier Huis an off-licence in Ossett West Yorkshire said it had sold most of its share already. David Jones Bier Huis\ owner said: There\s a number of breweries in Ukraine and they need to shift that beer to keep their company afloat and provide support for Ukrainian people. No-one will make any cash on it it will all go back to help with the war effort. Euroboozer said the truck containing pints left the Ukrainian capital on 31 March. The 370-mile (600 km) journey to Poland usually takes about 10 hours the wholesaler said but this trip took five days. IMAGE SOURCE EUROBOOZER Image caption The beer has been transported roughly 1400 miles (2256km) from Kyiv in Ukraine to Calais in France Martin Dawson of Varvar Brew said: The situation in Kyiv is unpredictable and we don\t know exactly how many days we will still be able to get our hands on our beer. Hopefully each and every beer that leaves the country can provide real enjoyment but also play a role in keeping our fight at the front of people\s minds. The lorry reached Calais in France on Thursday the wholesaler said with customers able to make additional donations on top of the beer price. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook Twitter and Instagram.

Ukraine refugees: Patel apologises for UK visa delays,"Figures show that of 41,000 refugees granted visas, only 12,000 have reached the UK.",Ukraine refugees: Patel apologises for UK visa delays By Mark Easton and Callum May BBC News Published 4 days ago Share Media caption Watch: Home Secretary Priti Patel apologises for Ukraine visa delay Home Secretary Priti Patel has apologised for the frustrating visa delays which have prevented thousands of Ukrainian refugees entering the UK. Just over a quarter of those Ukrainians granted visas - 12000 - have reached the UK so far Ms Patel told BBC News. Would-be sponsors of refugees have criticised the bureaucracy and ensuing delays in the Homes For Ukraine scheme. Home Office figures published on Friday show the government has granted 41000 visas to Ukrainians fleeing the war. Of the visas granted: 28500 were issued under the Ukraine Family Scheme and 12500 under the Homes for Ukraine Scheme which allow people to sponsor Ukrainian refugees In terms of arrivals into the UK: 10800 have arrived under the family scheme and 1200 under the sponsorship scheme I\ll be very candid it has taken time. Any new scheme takes time any new visa system takes time said Ms Patel. It\s been frustrating she admitted. I apologise with frustration myself. Ms Patel is the second government minister to apologise for the visa delays this week following the refugees minister Lord Harrington who told parliament that not enough visas had been issued. Streamlined The latest figures suggest there has been no significant increase in the speed of issuing visas to Ukrainian refugees despite assurances that processes have been streamlined. The Ukrainian Family Scheme had been issuing about 6000 visas issued per week but new data suggests that figure has fallen to just over 4000 in the latest seven-day period. The Homes for Ukraine Scheme has increased from 4700 in the first two weeks of operation to almost 8000 in the most recent week. The Home Secretary has described the UK response to the war in Ukraine as very generous. However the number of refugees physically arriving into the UK remains far below the numbers arriving in other comparable European countries. The German government said earlier this week it had accepted 300000 Ukrainians with refugees crossing the countrys open border with Poland - both countries are part of the Schengen area. Meanwhile 20000 refugees have arrived in Ireland which is not part of the Schengen area In March the European Union granted Ukrainian refugees rights to live and work in the EU and to access healthcare housing and education immediately for up to three years without going through a formal immigration process. Germany is an EU country said Ms Patel. They don\t have visa checks their borders are open. She said any comparison with the UK was not like-for-like: We are an independent third country and we want to give people the status and security of coming to our country along with the warm welcome. Desperate wait Fruit farmer Chris Tattersall from Torrington in Devon is waiting for visas to be approved for a refugee family he is sponsoring. Mr Tattersall and his wife Anne said they had a long wait after submitting visa applications for a woman they had contacted named Elena her elderly parents and young daughter. Image caption Chris Tattersall (R) and his wife Anne have sponsored a Ukrainian family but complain that bureaucracy is causing delays The family who are waiting in Poland were told the application had been accepted six days later. I\ve been worrying that six days for them is like six years Mr Tattersall said. I don\t know why the government wants to slow it down. There are people who are desperate. There are families sleeping on park benches in freezing temperatures in Poland. Why when they could be on a train for free across Europe and come here? IMAGE SOURCE FAMILY PHOTO Image caption Elena (R) and her family are waiting in Poland for their UK documents to be approved Labour shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called the visa numbers scandalous and shameful. Over 30000 people with British sponsors waiting are still stuck in limbo around half of whom have been waiting more than 10 days already to hear anything said Ms Cooper. Behind these numbers are many desperate mothers and children in temporary accommodation or still sheltering in Ukraine. British families have offered Ukrainians sanctuary in their hour of need but the Home Secretary is letting everyone down. Out of touch The Refugee Council accused the government of choosing control over compassion arguing that visas for Ukrainians should be waived in the short term. Asking Ukrainian families who are scared exhausted and traumatised to fill out a long and complex visa application is unacceptable and totally out of touch with the terrifying situation they find themselves in said the charity\s chief executive Enver Solomon. Priti Patel said she wanted to avoid a repeat of the Windrush scandal in which people who moved to the UK from the Caribbean later faced deportation. The Home Office kept no record of those granted leave to remain and issued no paperwork - making it subsequently difficult for Windrush arrivals to prove their legal status - and in 2010 destroyed landing cards belonging to those Windrush migrants creating further problems. Ms Patel also stressed the importance of security checks while insisting those checks were not causing delays to the system. I see security and intelligence - not just advice but reports - every single day. I know what is going on in the world. I know what is going on in the region. I know what Russia is capable of.]

Energy strategy: UK plans eight new nuclear reactors to boost production,The government wants to boost UK energy production and independence as household bills soar.,Energy strategy: UK plans eight new nuclear reactors to boost production Published 5 days ago comments Comments Share IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Up to eight more nuclear reactors could be approved on existing sites as part of the UKs new energy strategy. The strategy which aims to boost UK energy independence and tackle rising prices also includes plans to increase wind hydrogen and solar production. But experts have called for a bigger focus on energy efficiency and improving home insulation. Consumers are facing soaring energy bills after the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed gas prices even higher. Under the governments new plans up to 95% of the UKs electricity could come from low-carbon sources by 2030. It outlines for example the hope of producing up to 50 gigawatts (GW) of energy through offshore wind farms which the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) said would be more than enough to power every home in the UK. The governments energy strategy has been much-delayed with one of the big points of contention reported to have been the construction of onshore wind turbines. Key points of the new energy strategy Nuclear - The government plans to reduce the UKs reliance on oil and gas by building as many as eight new nuclear reactors including two at Sizewell in Suffolk. A new body will oversee the delivery of the new plants. Wind - The government aims to reform planning laws to speed up approvals for new offshore wind farms. For onshore wind farms it wants to develop partnerships with supportive communities who want to host turbines in exchange for guaranteed cheaper energy bills. Hydrogen - Targets for hydrogen production are being doubled to help provide cleaner energy for industry as well as for power transport and potentially heating. Solar - The government will consider reforming rules for installing solar panels on homes and commercial buildings to help increase the current solar capacity by up to five times by 2035. Oil and gas - A new licensing round for North Sea projects is being launched in the summer on the basis that producing gas in the UK has a lower carbon footprint than doing so abroad. Heat pumps - There will be a £30m heat pump investment accelerator competition to make British heat pumps which reduce demand for gas. Environmentalists and many energy experts have reacted with disbelief and anger at some of the measures in the strategy. They cannot believe the government has offered no new policies on saving energy by insulating buildings. They say energy efficiency would immediately lower bills and emissions and is the cheapest way to improve energy security. A Downing Street source said the strategy was now being seen as an energy supply strategy. Campaigners are also furious that ministers have committed to seeking more oil and gas in the North Sea even though humans have already found enough fossil fuels to wreck the climate. There is a strong welcome though for the promise of more energy from wind offshore with speedier planning consent. The same boost has not been offered to onshore wind. The decision to boost nuclear has drawn a mixed reaction. Some environmentalists say its too dear and too dangerous. They ridicule the idea from some politicians that every city could have its own mini reactor. But other climate campaigners believe nuclear must be part of the energy mix. Nuclear plans The new strategy says the government wants to lead the world once again in nuclear power reversing what it describes as decades of underinvestment. The government announced that a new body called Great British Nuclear will be launched to bolster the UKs nuclear capacity with the hope that by 2050 up to 24 GW of electricity will come from that source - 25% of the projected electricity demand. The focus on nuclear could deliver up to eight new reactors to be built on existing sites. The government hopes to have a new reactor approved each year until 2030 with the aim to have them up and running by 2050. It also confirmed advanced plans to approve two new reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk during this parliament. Wylfa in Anglesey and Oldbury in South Gloucestershire have also been named as candidates to host either large-scale plants smaller modular nuclear reactors or possibly both. The Great British Nuclear body will identify other appropriate sites. Tom Greatrex boss of the Nuclear Industry Association said the plans marked a vital step forward for the UK to meet its climate goals and could create thousands of jobs. The ambition and determination to do much more and quicker is very welcome he said. Whats in the UKs new energy strategy? Will the UKs energy strategy work? How much nuclear power does the UK use? How high could my energy bills go? The government said it would reform planning rules to cut approval times for new offshore wind farms with the ambition that by 2030 more than half of the UKs renewable capacity will be wind. For onshore wind the strategy commits to consulting on developing partnerships with a limited number of supportive communities who want to host wind turbines in exchange for guaranteed lower energy bills. However the strategy says there will be no wholesale changes to current planning regulations for onshore wind. Although it is one of the cheapest forms of energy new onshore wind projects have been declining since 2015 when the government ended subsidies and introduced stricter planning rules in response to some complaints that wind turbines were an eyesore and noisy. Defending the decision not to prioritise onshore wind Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK already had about 30GW of onshore wind capacity. Speaking at the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant he said onshore wind farms were controversial because of their visual impact and new sites will have a very high bar to clear. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption The prime minister visited the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset on Thursday Mr Johnson said the strategy was about tackling the mistakes of the past and making sure that we are set well for the future. Citing policies including a £6bn energy efficiency fund and support for heat pumps he said the government was already doing a huge amount to help people with the immediate cost of living and of course we are going to do more. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the strategy as too little and too late to help people with rising costs. All we\ve got today is a cobbled-together list of things that could and should have been done over the last 10 to 12 years and it doesn\t even tackle really important things like insulating homes which could save £400 on everybody\s bill he said. Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said it did not serve the needs of people or the climate. Mr Ramsay suggested that if the government was concerned about energy bills and taking real climate action it would be going even further on onshore wind. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the plans as utterly hopeless while the SNP\s Stephen Flynn called it a missed opportunity. No plans for new nuclear reactors in Scotland UK nuclear boost plan gives Anglesey plant hope Former Ofgem boss Dermot Nolan said: Most of these decisions will take a long time to have an impact and in the short run we will continue to be dependent on fossil fuels. He said the lack of focus on energy efficiency on insulation on improving the quality of people\s homes is an opportunity missed. Dr Simon Cran-McGreehin head of analysis at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit said: This is an immediate problem that needs solutions now and this doesn\t do anything on prices. It tries to do some things on energy supply but they\re all medium to long-term measures. So it does seem to fail the exam question he added.]
Will the UK's energy strategy work?,"The plan aims to increase UK electricity generation from nuclear, wind, hydrogen and solar sources.",Will the UKs energy strategy work? Simon Jack Business editor @BBCSimonJack on Twitter Published 5 days ago Share Related Topics Wylfa nuclear power project IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Its worth noting what this strategy is - and what it is not. It is not a plan to cushion the UK economy from the immediate cost of living crisis caused in large part by rocketing international energy prices. It is the governments attempt to increase the UKs resilience to future energy shocks. It does set out a plan to wean the UK off fossil fuels but acknowledges that we are not in a position to do that just yet. It also does not involve significant government spending beyond that which has already been committed and to its critics its a plan that fails to hit any of its various targets. New nuclear power forms the centrepiece of the plan. How much nuclear power does the UK use? Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? In addition to advanced plans to approve two new reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk during this parliament Wyfla in Anglesey is named as a candidate to host either a large scale plant smaller modular reactors or possibly both in the next parliament. The prime minister and the business secretarys enthusiasm for more onshore wind - the cheapest and quickest forms of renewable energy to deploy - has been tempered by fears that public and backbench MP opinion is divided. Communities that want them and the energy bill discounts that living near turbines could bring will still be encouraged to have them. Targets for hydrogen production are doubled with a plan to have a working facility by 2025 while targets for solar and offshore wind have been increased. The conflict in Ukraine has made a powerful argument for weaning the UK off fossil fuels in the long term but have also exposed the continued international reliance on them. Ministers are convinced that in the short term the world needs more gas. In the long term less. Plans to accelerate North Sea oil and gas projects will prompt dismay from environmental groups who argue that it will make little difference to energy prices that are set internationally. But supporters say it makes no sense to import liquefied gas from the US Qatar and elsewhere when domestic production that can provide UK jobs and domestic tax revenues is closer to hand. Above all this is a plan to secure future supply rather than reduce demand. Policies to reduce household and business consumption are largely limited to tax breaks to introduce privately funded energy saving measures. To its advocates its the moment when the government called time on a decade of drift in energy policy to its critics its a plan full of reheated ideas that has come too late.]

Queen's hospital donor placed on UK's Russia sanctions list,A major donor to the Edward VII's hospital is on the list of oligarchs sanctioned by the UK over Ukraine.,Queens hospital donor placed on UKs Russia sanctions list By Sean Coughlan Royal correspondent Published 5 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE MIKHAIL SVETLOV Image caption Viatcheslav Kantor pictured with President Putin has funded a new wing at the Edward VII hospital A major financial donor of the private hospital used by the Queen King Edward VIIs hospital has been put on the UK list of sanctioned Russian oligarchs. Viatcheslav Kantor whose name is still above the door of the central London hospital faces sanctions over Ukraine. The hospital recently opened the Kantor Medical Centre funded by Dr Kantor and so far is keeping its name. The King Edward VIIs is where the Queen has gone for medical care including a nights stay last autumn. The hospital describes itself as an independent charitable hospital with a proud history of royal patronage discreetly located within London\s Harley Street medical district. Prince Philip and other members of the Royal Family have also been treated there. Life governor of hospital Dr Kantor has been described by the UK government as the largest shareholder of fertilizer company Acron with vital strategic significance for the Russian government. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: We are showing the Russian elite that they cannot wash their hands of the atrocities committed on Putin\s orders. Dr Kantor had been life governor of the hospital but has stepped down from this role and from the board of trustees. IMAGE SOURCE JEFF J MITCHELL Image caption The private hospital has treated members of the Royal Family The oligarchs significant donations to the hospital have funded the Kantor Medical Centre opened this year which has seven floors of treatment and diagnostic services. It includes new facilities for MRI and CT scans ultrasound X-rays and consulting rooms and will have rooms for minor procedures. Outspoken royals show their colours over Ukraine More sanctions on Russia from the US and UK Dr Kantor funder of the Kantor Charitable Foundation has been a donor to many charities and arts projects in the UK. The foundations online photo gallery shows him with Russian President Vladimir Putin among other international figures. At the outbreak of the war in Ukraine the hospital had defended the acceptance of donations from the UK-registered charity funded by Dr Kantor. We share the deep concern felt by people across the world at the invasion of Ukraine said a statement from the hospital. Those on the sanctions list are subject to asset freezes meaning anyone in the UK or any UK company is prevented from dealing with any funds or property that is owned by them. Dr Kantor is among eight oligarchs who were added to the UKs sanctions list as part of its latest package of measures in response to Russias invasion of Ukraine. The others included fertiliser firm founder Andrey Guryev truck manufacturing firm director Sergey Kogogin diamond producer Sergey Sergeyevich Ivanov natural gas firm boss Leonid Mikhelson Gazprombank chief executive Andrey Akimov oil producer Gazpromneft chief executive Aleksander Dyukov and Boris Borisovich Rotenberg - the son of the co-owner of Russias largest gas pipeline producer SGM. Other sanctions include asset freezes on Russias largest bank Sberbank and Credit Bank of Moscow as well as plans to end imports of Russian coal and oil by the end of the year.

Covid infections show signs of plateauing in UK,"Nearly 4.9 million people would test positive for coronavirus, according to the ONS.",Covid infections show signs of plateauing in UK By James Gallagher Health and science correspondent Published 4 days ago comments Comments Share Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES The number of people infected with Covid in the UK is showing signs of plateauing data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests. Nearly 4.9 million people would test positive which is about 25000 lower than last weeks record high. Infections appear to be falling in Scotland which has had some of the highest Covid rates in the UK. A study published earlier this week also suggested cases may have peaked in children and young adults. The ONS infection survey tests thousands of people whether or not they have symptoms so is not affected by the end of free testing in England. It is seen as the best measure of the spread of coronavirus in the UK. Sarah Crofts from the ONS said: While infections remain high there are early signs in our latest data that they may no longer be increasing in some parts of the UK. It is too early to say if infections have peaked in England and Scotland. Infections have been soaring recently setting record highs. This has been driven by the highly contagious form of Omicron called BA.2 which is now thought to make up 90% of infections. In the week leading up to 2 April the ONS estimates: One in 13 people in England had coronavirus about 7.6% of the population - the same as last week One in 13 people in Wales had coronavirus about 7.6% - up from 7% last week One in 16 people in Northern Ireland had coronavirus about 6.2% - down from 6.7% last week One in 13 people in Scotland had coronavirus about 7.5% - down from 8.6% last week This wave of Omicron is far less deadly than those before mass vaccination but the sheer number of people catching the virus is still contributing to pressure on the NHS. The number of people in hospital with Covid also shows signs of levelling off after nearly doubling over the course of March. The number of hospital patients in the UK appears to have plateaued at about 20000. More than half of the patients in England have been admitted for other reasons but are testing positive for Covid. However hospital bosses have warned the health service is under enormous strain with Covid other conditions difficulties discharging patients and severe shortages of staff leading to backlogs.

Afghanistan: Asylum seeker waits for decision over UK refugee claim,Mohammed's family cannot leave Taliban-controlled Afghanistan until he is granted refugee status.,Afghanistan: Asylum seeker waits for decision over UK refugee claim By Maria Zaccaro BBC News Published 4 days ago Share Media caption Mohammed decided to leave Afghanistan after he was shot at by the Taliban while driving to work An asylum seeker who fled Afghanistan after being shot at by the Taliban fears his family is being put in danger by the delay deciding his claim. Mohammed whose name has been changed was forced to leave the country in 2021 without his wife and children when his life was threatened. He now lives in Hampshire but a year after claiming asylum in the UK he is still waiting for a decision. The government said it aims to consider claims without unnecessary delay. Mohammed left Afghanistan after his work campaigning for womens rights angered the Taliban who took control of the country when US forces withdrew. He said he decided to flee to the UK when his car was shot at while he was driving to work. Mohammeds family cannot join him in the UK unless he is granted refugee status by the government. Despite contacting the Home Office several times he has not been told why his application has not yet been decided. The governments website states asylum seekers usually get a decision within six months. He said: I am so much worried about them because the Taliban is conducting door-to-door search operations. I am afraid that when they will go to my home and when they will ask questions they will find that they all belong to me. Really difficult Like other asylum seekers Mohammed is also unable to work until his application is decided and has to live off a government grant of £40.85 a week. He has said this means sometimes he does not eat for a few days as he is unable to afford food. Living a life as asylum seeker is really really difficult. Sometimes I feel that I am not part of this beautiful world he added. But Mohammed said life in the UK was the only hope for him and his family and he would not stop fighting. Image caption Chris supports asylum seekers with their claims to be granted refugee status Chris a volunteer who works in support of asylum seekers has been helping Mohammed with his claim. He said many applicants wait more than a year for a decision to be made. The Home Office\s system is under-resourced and overloaded and unfortunately now there are many people waiting he added. A Home Office spokesperson said: The government is committed to ensuring asylum claims are considered without unnecessary delay.

Which areas of the UK's energy plan will we see in Scotland?,"Nuclear, wind and hydrogen form the core of the plan, but where does Scotland sit on the main points?",Which areas of the UKs energy plan will we see in Scotland? By Debbie Jackson BBC Scotland Published 4 days ago Share Related Topics Climate change IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Up to weight new nuclear facilities have been suggested by the UK government Scotland will not bring back nuclear reactors despite nuclear power being a central part of the UK governments energy strategy. Panning differences and devolved policies mean the strategy will be different for Scotland. So where does the country stand on the key points of the UKs blueprint? 1. Nuclear power Westminster has announced it plans to reduce the UKs reliance on oil and gas by building as many as eight new nuclear reactors. However the Scottish government has long been opposed to renewing traditional nuclear energy plants. Planning powers are devolved so any attempts to develop new sites could be blocked by Scottish ministers. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Scotland has one remaining nuclear power station and is unlikely to allow more to be developed The Hunterston B plant in North Ayrshire was shut down in January while the last station - at Torness in East Lothian - is due to close in 2028 two years earlier than planned. UK Energy Minister Greg Hands said in March it was a pity Scottish ministers were opposed to nuclear power saying he hoped the Scottish government would change its mind. The Scottish government\s Energy Secretary Michael Matheson insisted: Our position is very clear on nuclear we don\t believe nuclear needs to be part of the future energy mix here in Scotland and we have got no intention of taking forward nuclear developments. The UK Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng confirmed there were no plans to impose nuclear reactors in Scotland in future. 2. Wind farms The UK government aims to reform planning laws to speed up approvals for new offshore wind farms. This was welcomed by Keith Anderson chief executive of Scottish Power. He said: It takes five times longer to get a project through the UK\s planning system than to build it - that\s got to change if we\re to stand any chance of weaning our energy system off global gas and making a green future a reality. Low winds blamed for fall in Scotlands renewable energy production ScotWind: over the horizon and off the scale Will ScotWind auction deliver a renewables revolution? IMAGE SOURCE BOWL Image caption Beatrice is an offshore wind farm off Scotlands Caithness coast and more are coming Renewable and low carbon energy form the Scottish governments foundation for future energy systems. It aims to produce 50 gigawatts (GW) of energy through offshore wind. Its ScotWind auction of seabed plots for major offshore projects netted £700m. The 17 projects cover a total of 7000km2 which have a combined potential generating capacity of 25GW. Will the UKs energy strategy work? Steven Wheeler managing director of SSEs renewables division thinks the UK strategy will kickstart an infrastructure rollout across the UK. He said: We have plans for the world\s biggest offshore wind farm at Berwick bank at 4.2 GW. The challenge to get that over the line is to speed up the planning process. It has taken projects between eight to 10 years to go through the planning process and yet we can build a wind turbine in one day. For onshore wind farms the UK government wants to develop partnerships with supportive communities who want to host turbines in exchange for guaranteed cheaper energy bills. 3. Hydrogen energy UK targets for hydrogen production are being doubled to help provide cleaner energy for industry as well as for power transport and potentially heating. In November the Scottish government launched a £100m five-year plan to build Scotlands hydrogen economy. IMAGE SOURCE AFP Image caption Aberdeen has a fleet of hydrogen-powered double-decker buses Its ambition is for the technology to provide nearly a sixth of Scotlands energy needs by 2030. Aberdeen hydrogen hub could create 700 jobs by 2030 Oil and gas giant BP to partner Aberdeens hydrogen plans The Scottish governments Energy Transition Fund was also expanded to invest £15m in an Aberdeen Hydrogen Hub which will develop on-the-ground infrastructure to support the growth of a hydrogen transport fleet and the deployment of new applications across the north east. Oil giant BP has joined the project which hopes to create hundreds of jobs. The Aberdeen Hydrogen Hub is to have a solar power facility connected to a green hydrogen production and refuelling facility. Green hydrogen refers to when the gas is produced from renewable energy as opposed to methods that release greenhouse emissions. 4. Solar power Image caption Rising energy costs have made solar panels more worthwhile The latest Scottish government figures show at least 70000 solar installations in Scotland in 2020. Home Energy Scotland estimates an average three-bedroomed house in central Scotland would save £450 a year under current higher energy prices and the cost would be paid back in 15 years. Householders are currently waiting for up to a year to have them fitted with interest-free loans from Home Energy Scotland on offer 5. Oil and gas The UK government strategy has committed to more North Sea oil and gas projects. The government said it recognised the importance of these fuels to the transition and to energy security. It said producing gas in the UK has a lower carbon footprint than that imported from abroad. IMAGE SOURCE ETA Image caption A new round of licences will be granted by the UK government But climate advisers said UK-produced gas would be sold internationally and would barely reduce the consumer price. According to the Climate Change Committee new fossil fuel projects in the North Sea would in some cases not deliver gas until 2050. Friends of the Earth Scotland had previously called on the government to reject all new oil and gas projects due to the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels. The Scottish government expects a further leasing round on oil and gas from the UK government. Michael Matheson agreed these would continue to be an important part of the energy mix but said: We need to accelerate our decarbonisation our reliance on fossil fuel such as oil and gas. He said the energy systems of the future would focus on offshore renewable potential and moving towards that through Scottish government policies including ScotWind would deliver that. Mr Matheson added that it was the Scottish governments position that any new oil and gas reserves would need to be compatible with net zero objectives. 6. Heat pumps The UK government has promised a £30m heat pump investment accelerator competition to make British heat pumps. Heat pumps can replace household gas systems but are expensive to fit. While householders in England and Wales will be able to apply for a £5000 grant from April a cashback scheme worth £7500 is already in place in Scotland. But the profitable Renewable Heat Incentive which paid homeowners based on how much heating they produced recently ended with the financial year. Heated exchange for Scotlands homes Is it time to start producing my own home energy? The potential savings have grown to £261 per year compared with just £43 per year under the previous price cap. For those replacing an oil-fired system the savings could be as high as £607 per year.]

Nuclear: What's in the UK's energy strategy for Wales?,"Nuclear boost plan gives Anglesey plant hope, but opponents are appalled by plans for new reactors.",Nuclear: Whats in the UKs energy strategy for Wales? By Steffan Messenger BBC Wales Environment Correspondent Published 4 days ago comments Comments Share Related Topics Climate change IMAGE SOURCE ROLLS ROYCE Image caption The proposed design of Rolls Royces small modular reactor on Anglesey Backers of a new nuclear plant in Wales have had their hopes raised by the UK governments energy security strategy. It proposes a big push towards more nuclear power with the Wylfa site on Anglesey specifically mentioned. Targets for offshore wind are increased too with one firm saying that presented big opportunities for Wales. But opponents of nuclear power have said they are appalled at the strategy\s focus. Consumers are facing soaring energy bills after the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed gas prices even higher. In a bid to boost the countrys homegrown energy supplies and cut carbon emissions the plan proposes a new goal for nuclear plants to deliver 25% of the UKs electricity demand by 2050. Half a million in Wales face unaffordable energy Marine energy: Wales urged to be world leader Climate change: How will Wales go green by 2050? That requires a major expansion with all but one of the UKs existing nuclear power stations set to be decommissioned by 2030. Wylfa is mentioned alongside Sizewell in Suffolk and Oldbury in South Gloucestershire as favoured locations with the UK government saying it will immediately begin work to secure access to the sites. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Wylfa Newydd nuclear plant was switched off in 2015 and is being decommissioned Speaking to BBC Wales in Llandudno Conwy county Ken and Meriel Chippendale said: On a day like this wind turbines are a great idea but not nuclear because we haven\t decided what to do with the waste we haven\t solved that yet. With nuclear it\s not just an immediate problem it\s forever. Image caption Ken and Meriel Chippendale said they need to insulate their houses a lot more or walk quickly along the promenade because it is freezing Martin Platt said: I\m generally in favour of more windfarms possibly offshore is better but there needs to be a mixture of wind nuclear and solar. I think we need to increase nuclear if we\re going to get rid of fossils fuels we need something consistent when fossil fuel isn\t. Image caption Vicky Platt pictured with Martin Platt thinks windfarms are the way to go A new public body Great British Nuclear will be set up to bring forward new projects and a £120m fund launched later in April to help companies develop their plans. A partnership of US firms eyeing Wylfa hopes to access some of this funding with the Welsh Secretary Simon Hart having flown to Georgia to speak with them this week. If the technology is approved soon a fleet of small modular reactors (SMRs) will also form a key part of the nuclear project pipeline ministers said. Rolls Royce has previously told BBC Wales that Wylfa and the former nuclear site at Trawsfynydd in Gwynedd are at the top of its list of potential locations for deploying SMRs. Meanwhile another firm developing the technology - Last Energy - is also reported to be targeting Wales. Mark Salisbury chairman of the Wales branch of the Nuclear Institute described the energy security strategy as a great step forward for both Wylfa and Trawsfynydd. We\ve got fantastic sites here with host communities that are very used to operating nuclear power plants and have seen the benefits of generations of employment from these plants. How high could my energy bills rise? What financial help is there? Previous plans for a new power station at Wylfa fell through in 2020 after energy giant Hitachi pulled out over its cost. Mr Salisbury said there was now a concerted effort to address the financing issues of nuclear with a new finance bill which will dramatically reduce upfront building costs. That should make plants more deployable and that means cheap clean power for the consumer which will really help with energy prices he said. John Williams owner of Y Wygr fish and chip shop in Cemaes near the Wylfa site said a new power plant was needed for the sake of the island. In recent years - after the former power station shut - the shop stopped opening at lunchtimes due to dwindling passing trade. It\s affected the village quite badly - there\s no jobs around here - without Wylfa we\ll die completely he said. Likely to increase energy bills UK energy prices have been rising for months due to surging demand as Covid restrictions eased. But the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed up costs up even further. However Mag Richards of the Welsh Anti Nuclear Alliance claimed the strategys focus on nuclear power was likely to increase energy bills not lower them. We are appalled by this huge lost opportunity to address the immediate problems being faced by consumers and the climate she said. We need to act now by turning to renewables and energy storage not by adding extra taxes to already inflated energy bills to fund a technology that cannot deliver on time and will cost the earth. Offshore wind turbine hopes Higher targets for how much electricity is generated by offshore windfarms should lead to more being built off the coast of Wales. 50GW worth - enough to power every home in the UK - is being aimed for by 2030 - with 5GW of that to come from new floating windfarms. IMAGE SOURCE FALCK RENEWABLES AND BLUEFLOAT ENERGY Image caption Falck Renewables and BlueFloat Energy are planning two offshore windfarms in the Celtic Sea. They’ll each be capable of generating enough power for 230000 homes Saurabh Shah of Falck Renewables one of a number of companies working on plans for new windfarms in the Celtic Sea off Pembrokeshire said new targets would help attract investors. There is a growth story here for Wales he said. You start with these projects that will be among the first in the world at this stage and that will create future potential export opportunities. Plans to double the UKs low carbon hydrogen production capacity - as an alternative to gas and petrol - will also be welcomed in Milford Haven and on Anglesey where work is under way to develop hydrogen hubs. Media caption Expert explains what large storms mean for wind power Minimal reference is made to the potential for tidal energy - apart from the government saying they will aggressively explore the potential opportunities. Ministers also say they will work with Welsh government and the energy regulator Ofgem to improve grid capacity in Wales. This is considered a long-standing major issue - with parts of the network fully booked making it impossible for communities wanting to add new renewable energy schemes to do so. Will Henson energy policy lead at the Institute of Welsh Affairs said the grid was not fit for purpose across Wales. We\ve reached a point of decision making about what we want our national grid to look like - because that\s what\s going to underpin a lot of Wales\ ambitions to produce more energy through renewable sources. We need to be able to plug into that grid it needs to be fit for our needs in Wales - and (the power to do that) is obviously held in London.]
Why many experts aren't impressed with the UK's energy plans,"The new energy strategy will not help bills or carbon emissions in the short run, critics say.",Why many experts arent impressed with the UKs energy plans By Roger Harrabin BBC energy and environment analyst Published 4 days ago Share Related Topics Climate change IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Environmentalists are disappointed there are no new incentives for home insulation Environmentalists and many energy experts have reacted with dismay at the failure of the governments energy security strategy to cut emissions and bills in the short term. They welcome the long-term target to secure low-carbon home-grown energy supplies. But they say it does nothing new in the short-term to reduce bills cut emissions or decrease dependency on imported gas. They accuse the document of perversely down-playing the fastest and cheapest ways of combating energy dependency - namely energy efficiency onshore wind and solar power. Theres wide agreement among environmentalists energy experts and opposition parties that the UK needs a huge insulation programme to save houses leaking heat. But the document offers no new incentives for that A Downing Street source told me it was an energy supply strategy - not a demand strategy - even though experts point out that these are two sides of the same coin. Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng agreed the strategy would do nothing in the short-term to help reduce bills. The document was for major decisions in the longer term he told the BBCs Today programme. But the Treasury is reported to have blocked a plan to offer more short-term incentives to insulate homes. The government wouldnt comment on that. UK plans eight new nuclear reactors to boost energy Will the UKs energy strategy work? How much nuclear power does the UK use? Campaigners are also furious that ministers have committed to seeking more oil and gas in the North Sea - even though humans have already found enough fossil fuels to wreck the climate. Ministers argue that home-produced gas creates fewer emissions than imported gas compressed into tanks on ships. This is widely accepted but critics warn that as head of the UNs climate negotiations process the UK has a responsibility to lead other nations away from fossil fuels. Fracking is another contentious issue. After weeks of pressure from a small group of backbenchers the document opens a new inquiry into the process of smashing rocks underground to release trapped gas. But it would take many more years of exploration to see if firms could obtain a worthwhile amount of gas - and its likely to stir up local opposition as it did before. There is also growing concern of so-called fugitive emissions - that\s gas released accidentally into the atmosphere when the rocks crack. IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Meanwhile the governments much-trailed resolve to increase offshore wind has been applauded by climate experts. They welcome the news that ministers will ease planning hold-ups. There will be room too for more floating wind turbines to be used in deeper waters - and surplus energy from wind power will be used to boost the supply of hydrogen. Onshore wind has been more contentious. Its one of the cheapest forms of new energy - and one of the fastest to install. That means it could help with bills relatively quickly. But some Cabinet ministers have fought off a bid by the business department to ease the uniquely strict planning rules for onshore wind. They say some local people strongly object - even though polls consistently show a large majority of the population is in favour. As for the governments plans for nuclear power - which is now roughly twice as dear as wind and solar energy - theres still no solution to disposing of nuclear waste. Others deride government hopes for mini nuclear reactors serving individual towns and cities warning of security concerns and a public backlash. Some environmentalists say the nuclear price is worth paying to bolster the UKs climate law mandating near zero carbon emissions by 2050. Nuclear would ensure a proportion of the UKs electricity can be generated irrespective of the sun or wind. But theres scepticism whether the small modular reactors liked by the government will be ready in time. Experts warn that several previous prime ministers have promised a nuclear revival and failed to deliver. IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA The document has supporters. The governments Climate Change Committee applauded the strategy for its commitment to supply low-carbon energy. Its director of analysis Mike Thompson said: The new commitments are hugely ambitious - they would see the UK produce more electricity from offshore wind in 2030 than it has produced from gas in any year in history. Government business and industry will need to focus relentlessly on delivery at a scale and pace as yet unseen. But the committee joined the chorus of annoyance at the absence of measures to cut demand. And others went further in their criticisms. Helen Clarkson head of the non-profit Climate Group said: This strategy is all about jam tomorrow when we need deep emissions cuts today. We have tools and technologies already available which can radically reduce our energy needs and our carbon emissions now. Energy efficiency measures - such as insulation - can deliver immediately. There\s a huge opportunity for a win-win here which the government is passing up. Tessa Khan from the climate campaign group Uplift added: This strategy is a betrayal of the millions of families across the UK who are being pushed to the brink by energy bills caused by our reliance on gas. Instead of supporting them with a drive to insulate homes and boost our access to cheap clean renewable energy the government has sided with oil and gas companies who offer no solutions to our energy affordability crisis. Right now we need a real plan to help people across the country access safe affordable energy and instead the government has added fuel to the fire. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin]
"Hypersonic missiles: UK, US, and Australia to boost defence co-operation","The UK, US, and Australia are to begin research focused on how to defend against the super-fast weapons.",Hypersonic missiles: UK US and Australia to boost defence co-operation By Christy Cooney BBC News Published 6 days ago Share Related Topics Aukus IMAGE SOURCE EPA The UK US and Australia will begin co-operating on research into hypersonic weapons and how to defend against them the government has said. The programme will be part of the AUKUS partnership a security pact announced by the three countries last year. It follows the development of hypersonic missiles by China and Russia and their purported use by Russia in Ukraine last month. Hypersonic weapons are those that exceed five times the speed of sound. They are harder to defend against because of their speed as well as the fact they fly at low altitudes - beyond the line of sight of ground-based radars - and can manoeuvre mid-flight. The UK does not currently possess hypersonic missiles. The US and Australia have an existing joint programme to develop the weapons but the UK government stressed the focus of the new venture would be on defence. Could China’s hypersonic missile spark a new arms race? GCHQ chief warns China over Russia links It said there were no plans for the UK to develop its own hypersonic weapons but the new programme would help it assess whether it would need to develop them in future. It added the latest announcement was not related to Russias use of the weapons in Ukraine but said the fact other nations were investing in them meant the UK had to think about how to defend against them. On 19 March Russia claimed to have used a hypersonic missile to destroy an arms depot in western Ukraine and US military intelligence has suggested Russian forces have used them repeatedly since. The attacks would mark the first use of hypersonic missiles in combat. It came just months after China caught US intelligence by surprise when it tested two nuclear-capable hypersonic missiles. Each circled the globe in low-orbit space before coming back down to Earth the second missing its target by only about 24 miles (40 km). The missile is thought to combine a so-called fractional orbital bombardment system which sends missiles into a partial orbit of the Earth to strike from an unexpected direction with a hypersonic glider which remains in the outer atmosphere and is hard to detect until later into its flight. The tests demonstrated China had far more advanced space capability than had previously been understood. North Korea has also claimed to be in the process of testing hypersonic missiles. A potential game-changer Hypersonic missiles are potentially a game-changer in the way future wars will be fought. As their name suggests they travel at immense speed - Mach 5 or greater which equates to around a mile a second. They are what is called dual capable meaning they can carry either a conventional explosive or nuclear warhead. They can also be launched from either air sea or land. There are two types of these weapon: cruise missiles and glide vehicles. The cruise variant of which Russia has several can be launched from an aircraft and hit a target more than 1200 miles away. The glide variant is launched up into space from where it then glides down to earth on an unpredictable path. Hypersonic missiles are changing the way nations plan for their strategic defence for two reasons. Firstly they are so fast there would be very little time - just minutes - between a launch being detected and a countrys leader having to decide whether to retaliate. There is almost no way of knowing whether that missile is nuclear-tipped or not. Secondly their flight path especially that of a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) is so hard to predict it makes interception extremely difficult. Currently China is in the forefront of hypersonic missile development closely followed by Russia which has already used them to hit long distance targets in Ukraine. The US is late to the game and some of its tests have not gone well. Britain does not possess any and is only now forming an alliance with the US and Australia to carry out research into them and how if possible to defend against them. The AUKUS partnership announced in September 2021 is a trilateral security pact for the Indo-Pacific region. The primary purpose of the deal is for the US and UK to help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines. The deal also aims to deepen co-operation on cyber capabilities artificial intelligence quantum technologies and additional undersea capabilities. Following Tuesday\s announcement the UK\s national security advisor Stephen Lovegrove said: When we bring together the technical knowledge and capabilities of our three countries we can achieve a huge amount to help keep ourselves and our allies and partners safe. In light of Russia\s invasion of Ukraine it\s more important now than ever that allies work together to defend democracy international law and freedom around the world.

Energy: What does the UK's new strategy say?,The blueprint places a major focus on boosting supplies from nuclear plants and offshore wind.,Energy: What does the UKs new strategy say? Published 5 days ago comments Comments Share IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES The government has published its long-awaited strategy for increasing the UKs energy independence. The blueprint aims to move away from Russian oil and gas and boost renewable energy sources. Ministers are also under pressure to help tackle soaring energy bills facing consumers amid rising gas prices. The document has been delayed amid wrangling over the contents. So whats in it? Nuclear IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA The strategy contains an ambition to deliver up to eight new nuclear reactors before 2030 including two at Sizewell in Suffolk. The government wants nuclear to supply 24 gigawatts (GW) of electricity by 2050 - around 25% of the UKs predicted energy demand. The UK currently has 15 reactors that can supply about 20% of demand - with most due to cease operating before the end of the decade. Thirteen new reactors are at various stages of development but funding and approving new sites has presented major challenges in recent years. A new government body - called Great British Nuclear - will be set up to oversee the delivery of new nuclear plants. The government also recently acquired new powers to finance new projects by allowing developers to add costs to customers bills during construction. Ministers argue this will prove less expensive for energy customers than current funding models where these costs can only be added after a station starts generating electricity. How much nuclear power does the UK use? Wind IMAGE SOURCE GETTY CREATIVE Offshore wind is also a big part of the plans - with a new target to generate 50GW of energy by 2030. Ministers hope around a tenth of this could come from turbines based on floating structures which can be positioned further from the shore. The government has vowed to relax planning rules to speed up the approvals process from four years to one and set up a fast-track approvals process for priority projects. A senior source has also told the BBC that Boris Johnson wants to appoint a Kate-Bingham like figure to oversee new projects - a reference to the venture capitalist who led a government taskforce on Covid vaccines. There will be no new target however for onshore wind - which has proved unpopular with some Tory activists and MPs. The government has pledged it will not make wholesale changes to planning laws in England for onshore sites which were tightened in 2015. Instead it will consult a limited number of supportive communities about hosting new sites in exchange for guaranteed discounts on energy bills. Labour has accused the prime minister of caving to his backbenchers and not doing enough to boost new onshore sites. Is the UK about to build more wind farms? Oil and Gas IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA There will be a licensing round this summer for new North Sea oil and gas projects and a taskforce set up to support new developments. Ministers say they dont want to burn more gas but instead produce more of it domestically while they transition to renewables. Alongside the strategy a new scientific study has also been commissioned into fracking - the process of extracting shale gas from the ground. The controversial practice has been subjected to a UK ban since 2019 amid fierce local opposition and fears of earth tremors - but some Tory MPs have been pushing for it to be lifted. The business secretary says the war in Ukraine means it is right to look at all possible domestic energy sources. Kwasi Kwarteng pledged the ban on fracking would remain in place in England unless scientific evidence showed it is safe and causes minimal disturbance to nearby residents. What is fracking? Solar IMAGE SOURCE SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Theres an ambition to increase the UKs current 14GW solar capacity fivefold by 2035. Planning laws in England will be reviewed to promote the development of new solar farms on non-protected land. A consultation will also look at how to make it easier to put solar panels on rooftops including on public buildings. Supporters of solar say a new generation of farms could provide a source of renewable energy to power hundreds of thousands of homes. But plans for new farms have faced local resistance with a number of Conservative MPs also voicing their opposition. Hydrogen IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES The strategy contains a target to double UK hydrogen production to 10GW by 2030. The ambition is that at least half of this will come from electrolytic hydrogen - where electricity is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. This process of producing the gas can be greener than the most common production route used at the moment by reacting natural gas with steam. Low-carbon hydrogen production in the UK is still at an early stage with hopes that advances in technology can reduce costs. The target to boost production however comes with a caveat - it is subject to affordability and value for money.]

How many more wind turbines will the UK build?,"The government wants more energy to be generated by wind, but won't ""impose"" onshore farms.",How many more wind turbines will the UK build? Published 5 days ago Share The government says it wants to generate enough wind energy to be able to power every home in the UK by 2030. Its new energy strategy promises a major expansion of offshore wind turbines over the next few years but offers less to encourage onshore wind farms. What does the energy strategy say about wind? The government wants 50 gigawatts (GW) of the UKs electricity to be generated by wind by the end of the decade - 5GW of which its hoped will come from floating platforms in deeper seas off the UK coast. To this end its speeding up the time it takes for new projects to be given the go-ahead including cutting the approval time needed for new offshore wind farms from four years to one. However the government has offered little to reduce planning obstacles to onshore wind farms in the UK - which energy companies say could produce cheaper electricity more quickly. It says it wants to work in partnership with a limited number of supportive communities which will agree to host wind farms in return for lower energy bills. The energy provider Octopus currently runs a similar scheme. It says that 91% of customers surveyed said they would like a wind turbine in their local community if it meant cheaper electricity. The cabinet is known to be split on whether to relax planning restrictions for onshore turbines. Although Mr Johnson and Mr Kwarteng are thought to be in favour Transport Secretary Grant Shapps recently said he was against an increase in wind farms which he described as an eyesore. Business Secretary Kwazi Kwarteng told the BBC that the government wanted more onshore wind farms but said we can\t simply impose infrastructure on people if they don\t want it. Ed Miliband the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero accused the prime minister of having completely caved to his own backbenchers many of whom are opposed to onshore wind developments. UK plans eight new nuclear reactors to boost energy Will the UKs energy strategy work? Cabinet split over onshore wind expansion plan How many wind turbines does the UK have? There are now more than 11000 wind turbines on and offshore which produce nearly a quarter of the UKs electricity. Mr Johnson has said previously that he wants all of the UK\s energy from clean sources by 2035. To meet this goal offshore wind capacity would need to quadruple by 2030 and onshore wind capacity double. This would require between 1000 and 2000 new wind farms. The UK has been very successful so far in expanding offshore wind power and currently has the biggest capacity in the world. Why is onshore wind controversial? Onshore wind although cheaper than its offshore equivalent has seen a 94% decline in new projects since 2015. This was when the government ended subsidies and introduced stricter planning regulations in response to some communities who said wind turbines were an eyesore and noisy. Planning restrictions in England currently require onshore wind farms to be identified in local or neighbourhood plans. Both require community backing and local plans are only produced every five years - however many are not kept up to date according to the government. This has significantly slowed down the planning process. According to Zoisa North-Bond chief executive of Octopus Energy Generation it has extended the construction time from one to seven years. Concerns have also been raised that wind turbines might be a threat to birds although the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds says that if they are positioned away from major flocks then they would have minimal impacts. The question of noise has also been raised as an objection. There are no requirements for a minimum distance between turbines and homes - although some local authorities have set a distance of half a mile. From a 300m (984 feet) distance a turbine produces sound at 43 decibels - two below the maximum level recommended by the World Health Organization. How does wind power generate electricity? Electricity is generated when the wind turns the blades on a turbine. A generator inside the turbine converts this energy into mechanical power and electricity. The process produces hardly any greenhouse gas emissions (although some are produced when the turbines are constructed) which means it can play a major part in slowing climate change. However wind energy is completely dependent upon the weather - which is changeable. Wind can be generated all day unlike solar energy but it is difficult to predict. For example the UK generated 14% less wind in 2021 than in 2020 despite having 4.4% more capacity. For this reason the government has said the UK will continue to use gas and nuclear to provide a more constant supply to fill any gaps. How much do wind turbines cost? The cost of wind farms has dropped 30% in the last four years. Those currently being commissioned are at record low prices - selling for £39.65 per megawatt hour. By comparison the latest commission costs for gas were £50 per megawatt hour - these are predicted prices and dont reflect the current market prices which have risen significantly so future commissioned costs could be even higher.]

He then applied for them to live with him but after weeks of waiting they have decided to go to Ireland instead. A government spokesperson said they were moving as quickly as possible and had already issued almost 30000 visas.

He said it was a difficult and tiring process and at one point his family even considered giving up and going back to Ukraine. It\s been a really really difficult journey. I\ve been filling in these ginormous application forms which are still to be processed he said. Whats holding up the UKs scheme for Ukrainian refugees? His relatives had permission to stay anywhere in the European Union and spent the first few weeks in the Netherlands and Belgium. With their UK application taking so long to be processed they decided to go to Ireland because English is the first language there. He said they had been warmly welcomed and were staying at a hotel with other Ukrainian families. Image caption Mr Mandziuk drove to the Polish border to collect his cousin and her family Mr Mandziuk said his family now planned to stay in Ireland after what has already been an arduous journey - a decision he found really disappointing.

How much nuclear power does the UK use and is it safe?,Up to eight new nuclear power stations could be built as part of the government's energy strategy.,How much nuclear power does the UK use and is it safe? Published 5 days ago Share Related Topics Climate change IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Hinkley Point C nuclear power station is being built next to the older Hinkley Point A and B plants The government has announced plans to reduce the UKs reliance on oil and gas by building as many as eight new nuclear reactors as part of its new energy strategy. The aim is that by 2050 up to 24 gigawatts (GW) of electricity will come from nuclear - 25% of the UKs projected electricity demand. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says expanding the use of nuclear would help cut bills and resist bullying from Russia which dominates the European gas market. UK plans eight new nuclear reactors to boost energy Will the UKs energy strategy work? What is nuclear power? To create nuclear power in non-military reactors uranium atoms are bombarded by much smaller neutron particles. This causes the atoms to break down and release huge amounts of energy as heat. The heat is then used to boil water producing steam which drives turbines and generates electricity. This process does not result in greenhouse gas emissions and requires minimal mining for metals and other resources but does produce hazardous waste that needs to be stored for a very long time. BBC Bitesize: How is nuclear power generated? How much nuclear power does the UK use? There are currently six plants that can supply about 20% of UK electricity demand with 15% generated in 2020. This amount has declined since the 1990s with several plants reaching the end of their lives. Most of the existing reactors are due to cease operating and be shut down before 2030. The government says it wants to deliver up to eight new reactors overall with one being approved each year until 2030. Where are nuclear plants being built? The government has backed the construction of Hinkley C in Somerset which will be the largest nuclear station in Britain. It has also confirmed advanced plans to approve two new reactors at Sizewell C in Suffolk during this parliament. Wyfla in Anglesey has also been named as a site for a new nuclear power station in the next parliament. As well as larger nuclear power stations the government is also supporting Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) which work in the same way as conventional nuclear reactors but on a smaller scale. The energy strategy says the UK will collaborate countries such as Canada and the United States to accelerate work on advanced nuclear technologies including both SMRs and Advanced Modular Reactors (AMRs). How much do nuclear plants cost? Nuclear power plants are extremely expensive and complicated to build. Hinkley C - the newest of the UKs planned nuclear power stations - is already expected to be 30% over budget at £22 - £26 bn. The much smaller SMRs would cheaper at about £2bn - but obviously also generate significantly less power. IMAGE SOURCE ROLLS-ROYCE Image caption An artists impression of a small nuclear reactor The government also hopes a new financial funding model could cut the cost of new nuclear projects. But this could mean electricity customers have to pay part of schemes costs upfront through their energy bills. There is also the question of the price which will be paid for the energy generated by the UKs new nuclear plants. In 2013 the government agreed to pay £92.50 per megawatt hour ( for the electricity produced by Hinkley Point which would rise with inflation. Although this is considerably below current prices which have soared to £195 per megawatt hour due to the energy crisis critics argue it is still too much. Over the last five years the price has been between £25 and £50 per megawatt hour so if prices return to this bro would make nuclear power expensive. How long do nuclear plants take to build? Critics of nuclear power say they take so long to come on stream they will be too late for the UKs emissions targets or to reduce energy prices. In 2016 EDF Energy said construction of Hinkley Point C would take 10 years - last year it said it was on track to open by the end of 2026 although further delays are possible. A new body called Great British Nuclear is now being set up with the aim of overseeing and speeding up the time it takes to build and make nuclear plants operational. The government also says SMRs are quicker to construct than larger plants due to the smaller parts involved. Who uses nuclear power around the world? In mid-2021 415 civilian nuclear reactors were operating in 33 countries according to the World Nuclear Industry Status report. Together the big five - the US China France Russia and South Korea - generated 72% of all nuclear electricity in the world in 2020. The industry report says that the nuclear share of the global energy market is steadily declining. But two countries Belarus and the United Arab Emirates started their first reactors last year. Is nuclear power safe? The International Atomic Energy Agency part of the United Nations says nuclear power plants are among the safest and most secure facilities in the world. They are subject to stringent international safety standards. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES There was widespread alarm in March when a nuclear power station in Ukraine - the largest in Europe - was hit by shelling before being taken over by Russia. And there have been some high-profile accidents where large amounts of radioactive material were released into the environment. The worst nuclear accident in history resulted from an explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. A tsunami caused by an enormous earthquake flooded the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan in 2011. Even under normal conditions generating nuclear power produces hazardous radioactive waste which needs to be safely managed and stored for hundreds of years. But a House of Lords paper from October says the issue of nuclear waste remains unresolved in the UK. It is currently stored in temporary facilities that are not designed for the permanent storage of so-called high-level radioactive waste. The government\s preferred solution is geological disposal - placing waste deep in a rock formation that would prevent radioactivity from escaping. However no community has agreed to host such a facility. The road to clean energy Nuclear power: Are we too anxious about the risks of radiation? How green is nuclear power? Unlike fossil fuels nuclear power stations do not produce greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide or methane - and 1kg of nuclear fuel produces millions of times more energy than 1kg of coal. But like fossil fuels nuclear fuels are non-renewable energy resources. Building new nuclear plants of any size also creates emissions - for example through manufacturing the large amounts of steel and other materials needed. The long-term environmental consequences of dealing with nuclear waste are also unclear. A really simple guide to climate change What does net zero mean?

Drag Race UK's Bimini on how Great Yarmouth shaped their career,"Drag Race UK star Bimini Bon Boulash is proud their home town is ""fighting for queer visibility"".",Drag Race UKs Bimini on how Great Yarmouth shaped their career Published 7 days ago Share Image caption Bimini reflects on how growing up in Great Yarmouth shaped them as a person and performer Drag Race UK star Bimini Bon Boulash grew up in Great Yarmouth on the Norfolk coast and as a child was bullied for being different. Ten years after leaving the town they say they are so proud of how this small seaside resort has embraced drag and the way it could help other young people in the future. After coming second on the second season of the BBCs RuPauls Drag Race UK Bimini has modelled at London Fashion Week published a book and started a music career but until January they had never performed in their home town. Before moving to London for university at 18 Bimini then known as Tommy told the BBCs We Are England series they never felt they fitted in and at times experienced such levels of abuse that they felt unsafe. They said: I didn\t particularly feel that safe growing up. I experienced homophobia all the time. I was called all the slurs you could think of. I think it\s really sad to look back and think I stopped shining because of that. Image caption Bimini says they were bullied at school for liking drama and dance and felt pressured to give it up At school the non-binary queen was bullied for their love of dance and drama to the point they gave it up because they didnt feel like they could be their authentic self without the fear of what others would say. It was never the girls who would have a problem with me it was always the boys and boys in groups. It was that pack mentality said Bimini. I remember one time there was a group of teenagers a big group of boys kind of really tried to chase us and throw things. It was disgusting that kind of behaviour is just disgusting. I was getting pressured by people; sadly I was getting bullied for being able to dance for being flexible. I remember being told I didn\t have certain male anatomy because I was able to drop into the splits. And at the time I wish I felt like I do now - where I can put two fingers up and not care but at the time I did care] and took it upon myself to kind of stop doing the things people were making me feel bad about. Image caption Bimini says the iconic venues of Great Yarmouth shaped who they became as a performer However reflecting as part of the series they said that performing and watching shows as a child at some of Great Yarmouth venues including the St Georges Theatre and the Hippodrome Circus had shaped them as a performer. I\m not harming anyone by saying I\m non-binary I\m a human being I\m complex said BBB. I always knew I wanted to do something big and the fact these amazing places existed for me it was great because it allowed me to get to Bimini. The Drag Race star added: Bimini is the extension of Tommy. Bimini allows me to do the things I was shunned for or ridiculed for so I have been able to take back control of that in a way that feels good. Image caption Bimini performed in Great Yarmouth for the first time in January and says they are proud of the new drag scene In January Bimini performed at The Empire on Yarmouth sea front as part of a new drag show that runs once a month. Ahead of their first ever hometown performance they said it blows my mind adding they were so proud that my little home town is embracing this art from. They added it was incredibly important to see people fighting for queer visibility in Great Yarmouth. The full episode of Bimini Bon Boulash: Homecoming Queen is available on the BBC iPlayer.

Ukraine war sparks Welsh steam railways coal shortage,"Before the invasion of Ukraine, when supplies were low in the UK, operators turned to Russia.",Ukraine war sparks Welsh steam railways coal shortage Published 16 hours ago Share Image caption Ffestiniog and Welsh Highland Railway runs trains run from Porthmadog to Blaenau Ffestiniog and Caernarfon A shortage of coal is worrying vintage steam railway operators as they welcome visitors over the Easter holidays. When coal supplies are low in the UK they can usually turn to Russian coal but it is not available following the war in Ukraine. The UK has committed to ending all imports of Russian coal and oil. The manager at Ffestiniog and Welsh Highland Railway said he was concerned about supplies with only enough coal to last until the summer. Paul Lewin said: We\re perfectly fine for the Easter holidays and well into the summer. Image caption Paul Lewin manager at Ffestiniog and Welsh Highland Railway says coal supplies are concerning but not an immediate problem We are concerned… it\s not immediate said Mr Lewin adding: We are being careful with our fuel to make sure we can eke it out as long as possible. Ffestiniog and Welsh Highland Railway runs trains run from Porthmadog to Blaenau Ffestiniog and from Caernarfon to Porthmadog. It is one of a dozen heritage railways in Wales. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Coal stocks are running out fast according to Steve Oates from the Heritage Railway Association Fear for future of steam trains if coal banned Heritage railway back on track after lockdown Ffos-y-fran coal mine near Merthyr Tydfil was supplying the railway with coal but Mr Lewin said a piece of machinery broke in January which has affected supplies and the mine was due to close this year. It has started to test a new way of operating steam trains using rapeseed oil instead of coal. We\ve got some old small locos from quarries from the Welsh slate industry and they provide the ideal test bed. They\re quite small and we can make them work quite hard Mr Lewin said. We\re not the world\s experts in combustion but we are quickly having to become so in order to find a way through to the future. Image caption Rapeseed oil coal is being tested as an alternative to coal due to the uncertainty of supply Alex Hinshelwood operations manager of the Blaenavon Heritage Railway in Torfaen is also concerned about supplies. He decided to buy a years worth of supplies to make sure trains can keep running but even then prices had risen from £220 a tonne to £270 in just a few months. Such a large outlay in one go is also difficult for the small volunteer-run railway. IMAGE SOURCE BARBARA M FULLER Image caption Heritage railways attract an estimated one million visitors a year to Wales It is a worry but we\re hoping a little railway like this which burns about 180 tonnes of coal a year - a tiny amount compares to other railways - will be all right he said. Twenty-eight tonnes normally lasts us three or four months but the bigger railways are really starting to find it difficult because they haven\t got the room to store a year\s worth. Using old clothes to power engines Talyllyn Railway in Gwynedd has been experimenting with a blend of fuel called ecoal which includes anthracite coal and biomass which can be olive oil husks or even old clothing according to general manager Stuart Williams. But it is costly. Ecoal is at least double the price of what we\re paying at the moment which for a small operation can be quite an impact he said. We\re at the start of a journey but we run trains every day so we can have a little tweak every day. It\s quite interesting really. Steve Oates chief executive of the Heritage Railway Association told the Guardian that the situation was very serious. Our coal stocks are running out fast and the search is on to find alternative sources from overseas he said.]

"I haven't seen UK government feuding over refugees, says minister","Lord Harrington insists ""raised voices"" at meetings reflect a shared desire to help Ukrainians.",I havent seen UK government feuding over refugees says minister By Justin Parkinson Political reporter BBC News Published 5 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS A Home Office minister has said he has not seen any feuding between government departments over how to deal with Ukrainian refugees. Lord Harrington insisted raised voices in meetings were the result of a desire shared by all ministers to do the same thing and help people. He also revealed that 29000 visas had been issued to Ukrainians with around 65000 applications received so far. But Labour said the government had to step up to the plate. Several newspapers have reported that Home Secretary Priti Patel and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss have argued over how to clear a backlog of Ukrainian refugees\ applications amid reports that only hundreds of people have so far made it to the UK. UK offers £350 a month to Ukrainian refugee hosts UK can and will do more for refugees - minister How the sex trade preys on Ukraines refugees 100000 sign up to UKs refugee site in first day The BBC understands that HM Revenue and Customs and Department for Work and Pensions staff are now helping with the processing of Ukrainian refugees. A Home Office source said a cross-government effort was under way. Lord Harrington making his maiden speech since becoming a minister said during a Lords debate: I\ve not seen this feuding between departments that\s reported. He told peers he had attended meetings with Home Secretary Priti Patel and Housing and Communities Secretary Michael Gove among others adding: I\ve seen raised voices because we are all trying to do the same thing but not because we are angry] with each other... What happens behind closed doors I couldn\t possibly know... I\ve not experienced feuding] myself. Media caption Ukraine refugees: Visa process is beyond lengthy Lord Harrington said the immediate vetting of refugees should at most include passport checks verifying whether people are on criminal watch lists checking whether children travelling with adults are actually theirs and checking whether sponsors have criminal records - the last two designed to prevent people trafficking. That\s really it he added saying that it\s taken too long to do it so far. The government is operating two schemes to help Ukrainians displaced by Russias invasion to come to the UK - involving living with family members already in the country or sponsorship by other hosts. For Labour shadow Home Office minister Lord Coaker said: There\s a bureaucratic mess here and a bureaucratic quagmire and it needs to be sorted out. The British people want better from their government... They want their government to step up to the plate. The United Nations says 4.28 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded in late February. Of these neighbouring Poland has taken almost 2.5 million.

How can I offer a UK home to Ukrainian refugees?,"The government has said how many people are coming to the UK through its ""Homes for Ukraine"" scheme.",How can I offer a UK home to Ukrainian refugees? By Tamara Kovacevic BBC News Published 4 April Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES The government has announced how many people are coming to the UK through its Homes for Ukraine scheme. It lets people in the UK host refugees who dont have family ties here and was introduced after the government was criticised for not doing enough to help refugees fleeing the Ukraine conflict. How does the scheme work? The Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme also called Homes for Ukraine opened on 18 March. Theres no cap or upper limit on the number of refugees who can be sponsored under the scheme. The government said it hoped tens of thousands of people would benefit. More than 100000 people signed up to be hosts on the first day but critics have said the process is too slow and bureaucratic. As of 31 March 4700 visas had been issued out of 32200 applications made. Homes for Ukraine: Its sad slow and frustrating Who can apply to host a Ukrainian refugee? Anyone in the UK - of any nationality providing they have at least six months leave to remain in the UK - can apply to be a host through the government website. You have to be able to host the refugees in your own home or in another property for at least six months. Charities businesses and community groups will also be able to apply. Those offering to house refugees will be vetted by the government and Ukrainian applicants will also undergo security checks before being matched with a host. Local authorities will check that properties are fit to host refugees and DBS checks will be carried out for those hosting children and vulnerable adults. Do you have to know the refugee you want to host? In the first phase of the scheme people will need the name of a specific Ukrainian individual or family they wish to sponsor. The government advises them to get in contact with them directly and prepare to fill in a visa application with all their details and yours. Refugees with a valid Ukrainian international passport can apply online but those without one will have to go to a Visa Application Centre. These are operating in European countries including those bordering Ukraine such as Poland. Those who dont personally know anyone fleeing Ukraine can still register their interest on the governments website. They are also advised to get in touch with charities faith groups or local community organisations who are starting to make connections between individuals. Charities which work in this area include: Refugees at Home a charity connecting refugees and hosts online Room for Refugees which has previously settled unaccompanied child refugees with families in the UK Shelter 4 Ukraine a Ukrainian-run service which registers hosts and refugees Reset which has run a community sponsorship scheme for refugees since 2018 The training will include guidance on how to host the refugees and support refugees with language skills and education. The government has provided Reset with an initial grant of £300000 to run the service. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Will hosts be paid? Host households in the UK will be offered a tax-free payment of £350 a month for up to 12 months regardless of how many individuals they support. Only one payment can be made per residential address. The government website says hosts will not be expected to cover the costs of food and living expenses (although you may wish to offer this yourself). Local authorities will also receive £10500 in extra funding per refugee for support services with additional money available for children of school age. Support services include registering Ukrainian children in schools and arranging English language classes and job centre appointments for the refugees. What rights will the refugees have? Any Ukrainian national or the immediate family member of a Ukrainian national who was resident in Ukraine prior to 1 January 2022 will be able to apply to come to the UK. Those who are granted a visa under the scheme will be eligible to work and can access state benefits and public services for three years. Sainsburys Marks & Spencer and Morrisons are among UK retailers who have offered to employ Ukrainian refugees. Refugees fleeing Ukraine can bring pets with them when coming to the UK. The government has streamlined the quarantine process for these animals and will cover the costs involved. Why have so few visas been issued by the government so far? In addition to the lengthy paperwork refugees must submit to obtain both types of visas the government guidance for the Homes for Ukraine scheme states that applicants will be subject to a range of checks including: A visit from local authorities to ensure that properties are fit for purpose Basic DBS check if hosts are sponsoring adults Enhanced DBS check if hosts are sponsoring children under 18 or vulnerable adults The government has faced pressure - including from some Conservative MPs - to issue emergency visas or lift visa requirements altogether for Ukrainian refugees.

Capt George Bromley 36 who is based in Gloucester is taking on the Beeline Challenge - a straight line journey of around 745 miles (1200km). He will be making the trip to raise money for the charities that helped him recover from his injury. Capt Bromley said the challenge has given him something to reach for. He is raising funds for five different charities - the Armed Forces charity SSAFA the Limbless Veterans charity Blesma Rugby for Heroes Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion - who helped him fight his way back from the injury. The biggest challenge I faced was the mental battle he said.

That is something I really wanted to fight against. This challenge was something to reach for something to look forward to something to keep me going. Capt Bromley who is part of the Allied Rapid Reaction force in Innsworth said he has studied charts and tides in preparation but is still worried for any weather changes. The Bristol channel is a scary place. I\m going to be in the middle of it for the best part of a whole day he said. The Isle of Man and the Irish Sea that journey is about 43 miles (70km) so that is also a worry. Image caption Capt Bromley said he is most worried about the weather during the challenge Gloucestershire Blesma representative Chris Knight said Capt Bromley\s challenge is honestly incredible. If he was paralysed from his rugby injury there are charities that would have been there to support him he said. He\s now fundraising for those charities to acknowledge them.

Australia landslide: Tributes paid to UK family after deaths in Blue Mountains,A father who died with his son in the Australian mountains is named as lawyer Mehraab Nazir.,Australia landslide: Tributes paid to UK family after deaths in Blue Mountains By Joseph Lee BBC News Published 6 days ago Share IMAGE SOURCE WATSON FARLEY & WILLIAMS Image caption Mehrab Nazir was hiking with his family in the Blue Mountains when they were caught in a landslide killing him and his younger son Tributes have been paid to a British lawyer who died in a landslide with his nine-year-old son while hiking in Australias Blue Mountains. Mehraab Nazir 49 died with his son at the scene. His wife Anastasia remains in a critical condition while another son aged 14 is stable after surgery. Mr Nazir was a partner at a law firm working in Singapore where his family moved more than a decade ago. His firm said he was a dear friend and colleague. Watson Farley & Williams said they would be remembering and honouring him. The alarm was raised on Monday afternoon by the familys 15-year-old daughter after the landslide killed her father and younger brother leaving her mother and older brother critically injured. The teenage girl was said to be extremely distressed and is being kept in hospital under observation. UK father and son 9 die in Australian landslide The two bodies were recovered from the mountains near the popular walking spot of Wentworth Falls about 60 miles (96km) from Sydney at about 09:30 local time on Tuesday. Tour guide Graham Chapman said landslides are common in the Blue Mountains and have been made more likely by recent heavy rain. This beautiful family from England were just in the wrong place at the wrong time it\s so sad he said. Maybe another 50 metres either side or a delay during the day this wouldn\t have happened. IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA A year dominated by storms and floods by Phil Mercer in the Blue Mountains Torrential rain has returned to the Blue Mountains. Thick bands of low cloud have moved in obscuring buildings and bushland. As the rain beats down near Wentworth Falls car headlights occasionally emerge from the mist. But this popular tourist destination is mostly quiet: walking tracks and some roads have been closed. Months of heavy downpours are likely to have been a key factor in the tragedy involving the family of five from Britain. They came on a day of rare sunshine in a year thats been dominated in much of eastern Australia by storms and floods. In this World Heritage area the ground is sodden and signs warn of the dangers of rockfalls and landslips. The earth and the famous sandstone cliffs have become saturated and still it rains. Landslides here are not uncommon - but rarely if ever have they devastated the lives of an entire family. The family had set out on the hike on Monday in bright sunny weather but the Blue Mountains had previously been lashed by weeks of heavy rain. Mr Chapman said: I\ve seen so many landslides I couldn\t tell you how many. But the thing is with landslides here in the mountains you don\t actually get to hear about them a lot because it\s so remote. Here in the mountains it can change in the blink of an eye and sadly for the English family that\s exactly what happened the other day. He said he had cried when he heard the news of their deaths adding: We\ve only just opened up our international borders and to know that that family has come to our country and that this has happened on our soil man it\s just heart breaking. The family are understood to be members of the Zoroastrian religion an ancient Iranian faith. Zubin Appoo president of the Australian Zoroastrian Association of New South Wales said the accident was beyond tragic. Everyone is shocked and so many in our community are reaching out to offer support in any way they can. Mr Appoo said tributes to the family were flooding in adding that the religion had a small and tight-knit global community. New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation the incident was tragic and said he would be seeking advice as to whether the walking track should have been open. The Department of Environment and Heritage in the state said the area was closed to the public until further notice and a comprehensive review would be undertaken. It said it had a world-class programme in place to assess the risks of incidents such as landslides but it is not possible to predict and eliminate all natural risks. The walking trail had been inspected days before the landslide as part of a routine assessment the department said.

Ukraine war: Putin says Russian invasion will achieve 'noble' aims,"Speaking at a Russian space centre, Mr Putin claimed his invasion aimed to help people in the Donbas.",Ukraine war: Putin says Russian invasion will achieve noble aims Published 1 hour ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Vladimir Putin said war with Ukraine had become inevitable Russian leader Vladimir Putin has said his invasion of Ukraine will achieve what he called its noble aims. Speaking alongside Belarusian leader Aleksandr Lukashenko Mr Putin claimed that a clash with Ukraine had become inevitable. Mr Putin said he had been left with no choice but to launch the invasion in a bid to protect the Russian speaking Donbas region. The UN says 10 million people have fled their homes since the invasion began. But during a public appearance marking the 61st anniversary of Yuri Gagarin becoming the first man in space Mr Putin insisted that his forces are aiding oppressed people in separatist regions of Ukraine. On the one hand we are helping and saving people and on the other we are simply taking measures to ensure the security of Russia itself the 69-year old insisted. It\s clear that we didn\t have a choice. It was the right decision he said adding the goals are perfectly clear they are noble. The Kremlin claims that Ukraine has committed genocide against Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine but there is no evidence to suggest that is the case. More than 10 million people have been forced to flee their homes since the invasion began and the Russian economy has been rocked by a package of severe sanctions imposed by Western nations. However the Russian president said that Russia does not intend to be isolated arguing that it is impossible to severely isolate anyone in the modern world - especially such a vast country as Russia. Speaking from the Vostochny Cosmodrome some 3450 miles (5550 km) east of Moscow the Russian leader also drew upon the success of the Soviet space programme comparing Gagarins achievement during the Cold War to Russias current international isolation. The sanctions were total the isolation was complete but the Soviet Union was still first in space Mr Putin said. Mr Lukashenko also dismissed the impact of sanctions asking Mr Putin why an earth are we getting so worried about these sanctions? Last week the UK government predicted that Russia is heading for its deepest recession since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The UK Foreign Office said Russias GDP is expected to contract by between 8.5% and 15% this year as the impact of international sanctions take hold.]
Wylfa: UK minister visits US hoping for nuclear deal,Welsh Secretary Simon Hart heads to US for talks with two firms interested in the plan.,Wylfa: UK minister visits US hoping for nuclear deal Published 6 days ago Share Related Topics Wylfa nuclear power project IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Previous plans for a new nuclear power plant at Wylfa collapsed due to a lack of UK government funding The Conservative Welsh secretary is heading to the US to help move forward proposals for a new nuclear power plant in north Wales. Simon Hart will visit the Vogtle plant in Georgia being built by two firms in talks over proposals for a scheme at Wylfa. Mr Hart said he hopes the visit moves us a step closer to a deal over the plan. He said the UK government is deadly serious about large scale nuclear. But he said the UKs energy strategy to be published on Thursday is unlikely to mention Wylfa by name. The Vogtle plant is being assembled by the engineering firm Bechtel with two new Westinghouse reactors. Last year UK officials revealed talks had taken place with both companies about Wylfa. The Georgia project is behind schedule and behind time with the Reuters news agency and local media reporting on fresh delays in recent months. How much nuclear power does the UK use? What do we know about the UKs new energy strategy? Speaking to BBC Wales Mr Hart said Thursday\s statement will outline what the UK\s ambitions are for nuclear and in the context of energy security and reliability. What Bechtel and Westinghouse want to hear from us and they\ll hear it from me... is that we\re deadly serious about large scale nuclear in the UK and in particular on this fantastic site on Anglesey]. Part of the plan is the release of money in due course from the future nuclear fund which will enable them to build up a business case and for us to be able to hope the US and] UK shake hands on one of the biggest nuclear developments in recent times. If this week\s visit moves us a step closer to that position then it will be a very worthwhile exercise. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Plans for new reactors at Vogtle in Georgia are reportedly behind schedule and overbudget He said one of the reasons he is going is to establish why there is a delay at the Vogtle plant and if lessons have been learned when and if it comes to something similar on Anglesey. But he said it was a bit dangerous to say the energy strategy itself will namecheck Wylfa. This is about a broader strategic importance of things like floating offshore wind and nuclear. If we get really encouraging signs from UK government from my colleagues on Thursday about where nuclear fits in our plants then I think that\s I hope going to be the source of some optimism for people who\ve been led to the edge and back a few times with Wylfa in the past. Clearly we want to try avoid doing that again. We want this thing to actually happen sooner than later. He added there were really encouraging signs coming from the Crown Estates about what\s possible with the Celtic Sea off the west coast with offshore wind. There\s almost unlimited capacity for floating offshore. The UK governments Energy Strategy is expected to be published on Thursday and is set to show how the UK will establish more secure sources of energy over the coming years and meet targets to phase out carbon emissions. Security demands have increased following Russias invasion of Ukraine and the threat - both moral and real - to gas and oil supplies. On the weekend the UK government Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said six or seven new nuclear reactors could be built by 2050. It has also been reported that ministers have agreed to set up a new development body called Great British Nuclear to identify sites cut through red tape to speed up the planning process and bring together private firms to run each site. There would still be a considerable way to go before any deal is struck to build a new nuclear power station. Any company interested would need to raise a substantial amount of private sector investment as well as receive significant support from the state. The UK government\s Future Nuclear Enabling Fund would be expected to provide millions of pounds of tax payers money as a kick start to any scheme. Longer term a Regulated Asset Base model of funding could be used.]

Ukraine war in maps: Tracking the Russian invasion,"After withdrawing troops from the north of Ukraine, Russian shifts its focus to capturing more territory in the east.",Ukraine war in maps: Tracking the Russian invasion By The Visual Journalism Team BBC News Published 4 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Russia is now focusing on taking territory in the eastern regions of Ukraine having fully withdrawn troops from north of the country. Here are the latest developments on day 46 of the invasion: Ukraine and Russia are building up their military forces in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk The US and Britain say they are looking into reports that Russian forces have used chemical weapons in Mariupol Russian forces continue to capture ground in Mariupol but pockets of Ukrainian resistance remain Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February but its forces have now fully withdrawn from around the capital Kyiv and northern Ukraine to Belarus and Russia. Fighting in eastern Ukraine is expected to intensify in the coming weeks as Russia continues to refocus its efforts there according the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD). Russian units in Belarus are being redeployed to support those operations the MoD says. Russia targets full control in the east Russian officials have said that the focus of their forces is now the complete liberation of the Donbas which broadly refers to Ukraine\s eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion. Western officials say they expect Russia to double or even possibly triple its troops numbers in the Donbas. Reports and satellite images suggest a build-up of Russian forces is underway on Ukraines border in Russias Belgorod Voronezh and Rostov regions. Reinforcements are also building up in the Kharkiv region to support the Russian push south. They are hoping to advance down from Izyum towards Slovyansk and encircle Ukrainian forces according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Meanwhile Russian troops continue to launch air and artillery attacks on Kharkiv and other cities. The Ukrainian governor of Donetsk said told the BBC there were battles all day every day along the demarcation line between the two sides. Ukraine is also reported to be deploying reinforcements but not on the same scale as the Russians. The governor of Luhansk has called on all civilians to evacuate to safer regions in the centre or west of Ukraine. War in Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine WHAT NEXT? Three ways it could escalate WAR CRIMES: Russian soldiers raped me and killed my husband ANALYSIS: Hidden wealth of one of Putin’s inner circle revealed READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Russian progress slows in the south Russian forces initially made rapid gains in the south with their main objective being the creation of a land corridor between Crimea which it annexed in 2014 and areas held by Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk. Standing in the way of that objective has been the port city of Mariupol which has been encircled by Russian forces since the start of March. Russian forces have been slowly pushing into the centre of the city meeting fierce resistance from the Ukrainians. Pockets of Ukrainian fighters remain but Russian troops have now reached the port and divided the Ukrainian forces there into two areas. Analysts say it is unclear how much longer the Ukrainians can hold on. The US and Britain say they are looking into reports that chemical weapons have been used by Russian forces against Ukrainian militia guarding the citys Azovstal steelworks. To the west Russia had been attempting to push towards Odesa with the aim of cutting off Ukraines access to the Black Sea. Their advances stalled at Mykolaiv where a counter-attack by Ukrainian troops pushed Russian forces back towards the city of Kherson. The ISW believes that after successfully resisting Russian counter-attacks in the region Ukrainian troops may attempt larger-push in the direction of Kherson city in the coming weeks. Ukraine controls the areas around Kyiv in north Over the past week after failing to reach or fully encircle the capital city of Kyiv Russian forces have withdrawn from northern Ukraine. Their retreat has allowed a clearer picture to emerge of the huge amount of damage and destruction to lives and property in towns and villages seized during their push towards the capital with allegations of war crimes having been committed by Russian troops. The Russian withdrawal has also allowed Ukrainian forces to retake the area around Chernihiv a strategically important city to the north-east of Kyiv that sits between the capital and the Russian border.

About these maps To indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the Institute for the Study of War with the American Enterprise Institutes Critical Threats Project. From 2 March this daily assessment differentiated between Assessed Russian-controlled Ukrainian territory and Assessed Russian advances in Ukraine the latter indicating areas where Russians are believed to have launched attacks from but which they do not control. To show key areas where advances are taking place we are also using daily updates from the UK Ministry of Defence and BBC research. The situation in Ukraine is fast moving and it is likely there will be times when there have been changes not reflected in the maps.

Ukraine War: US 'deeply concerned' at report of Mariupol chemical attack,Ukrainian forces in Mariupol say a Russian drone dropped a chemical substance on the city overnight.,Ukraine War: US deeply concerned at report of Mariupol chemical attack Published 5 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Russian forces allegedly launched the attack on the Azovstal metals plant where the Ukrainian troops are said to be entrenched The US and Britain say they are looking into reports that chemical weapons have been used by Russian forces attacking the Ukrainian port of Mariupol. Ukraine\s Azov regiment said three soldiers were injured by a poisonous substance in an attack on Monday. However no evidence has been presented to confirm the use of chemical weapons. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said officials were working to urgently investigate what she called a callous escalation of the war. The Pentagon called the potential use of the weapons deeply concerning. Western nations have warned that the use of chemical weapons would mark a dangerous escalation of the conflict and have pledged to take firm action if Russia carries out such attacks. Ukraines Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said the government was investigating the allegations adding that early assumptions suggested phosphorous ammunition had been used. Phosphorus is not classed as a chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Convention but using it as an incendiary weapon near civilians would be illegal. On Tuesday pro-Russian separatist forces in Donetsk denied carrying out the attack. Chemical forces The Azov battalion which has been heavily involved in fighting in Mariupol and has strong ties to the far-right wrote in a Telegram post that Russian forces had dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin during a drone attack at the city\s large Azovstal metals plant. It said that its fighters had suffered minor injuries including shortness of breath. One injured man described a sweet-tasting white smoke covering an area of the plant after an explosion. Another said he felt immediately unable to breathe and had collapsed with cotton legs. The reported incident - which the BBC cannot independently verify - came hours after a spokesperson for the Moscow-backed Donetsk People\s Republic urged Russia to bring in chemical forces to the besieged south-eastern city. Eduard Basurin told Russian state TV the remaining Ukrainian forces in Mariupol were entrenched at the Azovstal plant and that Russia should encircle it and smoke out the moles. Speaking on Monday night President Volodymyr Zelensky said any use of chemical weapons would mark a new stage of terror against Ukraine and called on Western nations to arm his forces with the weapons needed to defend his country. Unfortunately we are not getting as much as we need to end this war sooner Mr Zelensky said. I am sure that we will get almost everything we need but not only time is being lost. The lives of Ukrainians are being lost — lives that can no longer be returned. UK Defence Minister James Heappey ruled nothing out in terms of a Western response if a chemical attack was confirmed. There are some things that are beyond the pale and the use of chemical weapons will get a response and all options are on the table for what that response could be he said. Last month US President Joe Biden said Nato would respond if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use he said.]

The drug with a potential street value of £302m was found within five pallets of bananas at Southampton docks on 17 March. Home Secretary Priti Patel said it was the largest seizure of cocaine in the UK since 2015. Border Force said the cocaine hydrochloride - used to make crack cocaine - weighed about 3.7 tonnes.

2+2 talks: How India and US agreed to differ on Ukraine war,The countries showed willingness to understand their differing stands on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.,2+2 talks: How India and US agreed to differ on Ukraine war By Vikas Pandey BBC News Delhi Published 4 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Mr Modi and Mr Biden held a virtual meeting on Monday Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Bidens virtual meeting came on the back of their differing stands on Ukraine. Days before their meeting Mr Biden had called India\s stand somewhat shaky and one US official had warned that India had been informed that the consequences of a more explicit strategic alignment with Moscow would be significant and long-term. But India stood firm in its stand despite what appeared to be growing pressure from the US. Delhi continued to promote dialogue to end the war. It didnt criticise Russia directly but chose some strong words about the need to respect the sovereignty of each nation. In that backdrop the leaders summit - which was not planned and was requested by the White House - is significant for geopolitical developments. It was followed by the planned annual 2+2 Dialogue between Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and their US counterparts Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin in Washington. Its evident from the statements that both sides have shown willingness to understand each others positions on Ukraine. Pratyush Rao director for South Asia at Control Risks consultancy said the visit came at a sensitive time for the relationship. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Mr Modi shares good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin This was a visible reaffirmation at the highest levels by both sides to the bilateral relationship amidst all the media speculation about deepening strains over the Ukraine conflict. The message was yes we do differ on Russia and will unlikely bridge the gap but won\t allow it to derail wider co-operation in the Indo-Pacific either he added. While PM Modi and his ministers reaffirmed their stated policy of non-alignment on Ukraine Mr Biden and his ministers appeared more understanding of Delhis position - a marked shift from some earlier strong statements of Washington officials. Mr Blinken said India has to make its own decisions about how it approaches this challenge. He also noted that India had issued strong statements at the UN and it had called for an independent investigation into the killings of civilians in Ukraine\s Bucha. In a candid remark he said India\s relationship with Russia has developed over decades at a time when the United States was not able to be a partner to India. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Many Ukranian towns have been destroyed in the war He added that times have changed and the US was willing to be a partner of choice with India across virtually every realm - commerce technology education and security. Former Indian diplomat Anil Triguniyat said this statement showed that the US has understood Indias position in a broader geopolitical context. Both sides have too much to lose if the bilateral relations are strained. Their relationship is rich and the meetings just reaffirmed that he added. Beyond Ukraine the two sides also reaffirmed their commitment in continuing co-operation in the Indo-Pacific and also in the trade defence and security sectors. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Ukraine has also accused Russia of indiscriminate shelling of its cities The US said it saw India as a net provider of security in the region. China is seeking to refashion the region and the international system more broadly in ways that serve its interests Mr Blinken said. Both the US and India agree on playing a bigger role in the region to counterbalance Chinas growing influence. India has a long disputed boundary with China. Their troops were involved in deadly clashes in the Galwan valley in 2020 that resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers. China said later it lost four troops in the clash. Ukraine looms large over Biden-Modi talks Why India is not criticising Russia over Ukraine What Putins India visit means for world politics Mr Jaishankar acknowledged that the Quad - which includes India the US Japan and Australia - had emerged as a powerful force for global good and its elevation benefits the entire Indo-Pacific. Mr Rao said India reposing its faith in the Quad was significant. Russia Indias time-tested ally has criticised the Quad and called it a forum to target China. Both Moscow and Beijing have become closer and often jointly taken stands against the West. In that context Mr Rao said that the Indian foreign ministers public and unequivocal endorsement of the Quad was important and will likely resonate among his audience in Washington. Defence ties Washington also acknowledged that Russia is Indias biggest defence supplier - accounting for more than 50% of its imports. In contrast the US was Indias second-largest supplier between 2011 and 2015 after Russia but fell behind France and Israel in the period between 2016 and 2021. Former Indian diplomat Jitendra Nath Misra said India continued to import from Russia because it got good value for money and crucially transfers of technology in some areas. The US needs to give commitments on technology transfers to be able to get a bigger share of India\s defence imports he said. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption A Russian S-400 anti-aircraft weapon system in Crimea Defence Minister Singh talked about PM Modi\s Make in India campaign and invited US defence companies to set up shop in India. But there hasnt been any big-ticket announcement on this. However a significant measure was announced about the two countries jointly developing air-launched unmanned aerial vehicles. More such measures are needed to address India\s defence needs and help reduce its dependence on Moscow Mr Misra added. But the crucial issue of Indias acquisition of Russias S-400 missile defence system remains unsolved. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption The leaders meeting was held at the request of the White House The purchase has come under the Countering Americas Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa) which was introduced in 2017 to target Russia Iran and North Korea with economic and political sanctions. It also prohibits any country from signing defence deals with these nations. Mr Blinken said the US had not made a determination regarding potential sanctions or potential waivers under the CAATSA law. There was also a veiled suggestion to India when Mr Blinken said the US was asking countries to avoid major new transactions for Russian weapons systems. Mr Triguniyat says the ambiguity over the S-400 showed that the US wanted to keep its options open but it doesnt want to rock the boat at the moment. Its clear that there is a lot more ground to cover for the US to replace Moscow as Indias largest defence supplier. Meanwhile Mr Blinken also talked about India\s human rights record saying the US was monitoring some recent concerning developments in India including a rise in human rights abuses by some government police and prison officials. The Indian ministers didnt respond to this but analysts say Democrats including former president Obama have raised such issues in the past. The statement may have caused discomfort to Indians but analysts say its unlikely that the issue will become a major irritant in the relationship. Energy and trade Indian companies have been trying to circumvent sanctions to take advantage of the discounted oil prices being offered by Russian firms. When this question was put to Mr Jaishankar he denied that India was ramping up its oil imports from Russia. I suspect looking at the figures probably our total purchases from Russia] for the month would be less than what Europe does in an afternoon. So you might want to think about that he said. The US has steadily increased its export of crude oil and refined petroleum products to India - accounting for 15% of India-US trade which stood at $113bn in 2021. The two countries believe that there is vast potential to take the bilateral trade to $500bn in the future. The two sides announced a series of measures including restarting the US-India Commercial Dialogue and the US-India CEO Forum to improve trade ties.]

Diesel delivery highlights UK dependence on Russia,Russia supplies nearly a fifth of UK diesel - the UK says it will stop imports by the end of the year.,Diesel delivery highlights UK dependence on Russia By Ben King Business reporter BBC News Published 3 April Share IMAGE SOURCE ALAMY On Saturday afternoon a bright red tanker carrying 33000 tonnes of Russian diesel sailed up the Thames and delivered its cargo in Grays Essex. Its arrival - which doesnt violate sanctions - highlights the UKs dependence on Russia which supplies nearly a fifth of the countrys diesel. The UK has pledged to stop importing Russian diesel by the end of the year: until then the deliveries continue. Russian-owned or flagged vessels are now banned from UK ports. But the STI Comandantes journey from Primorsk on the Baltic sea does not flout the Ukraine-related sanctions on Russia because the ship is owned by the US firm Scorpio Tankers and flies the flag of the Marshall Islands a nation in the Pacific Ocean. Some shipping lines including the global giants Maersk and MSC have chosen to suspend most deliveries to and from Russia. Others have decided that as long as the trade is still legal and safe they will continue. Its a controversial choice. “This shipment of diesel along with the other fossil fuels that have been allowed to enter the UK since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is filling Putin’s coffers and helping to fund the war. It has to stop” said Emily Armistead programme director at Greenpeace UK. Greenpeace has set up an automated tracker to monitor movements of tankers leaving Russia loaded with oil and diesel. The STI Comandante was chartered by ST Shipping a subsidiary of the commodity giant Glencore. Glencore doesnt necessarily own the diesel on board though - it may well have been bought and sold many times while the boat was on the water. Diesel prices rising faster than petrol Phasing out Russian oil will be extremely hard and diesel will be particularly difficult. Russia supplies 8% of the UK’s oil needs but 18% of its diesel according to government figures. Diesel is essential to a modern economy. Besides fuelling more than a third of UK cars it powers trucks buses some trains farming and construction equipment and is used for generating electricity. The Ukraine crisis has led to a shortage of diesel across Europe which depends on Russia for about half of its diesel imports. This shortage has been reflected in the prices that drivers pay for diesel at the pump which have been rising faster than petrol prices. The average price of diesel in the UK has risen 18% since the start of February to 177p a litre while the average cost of unleaded has risen by 11% according to RAC Fuel Watch. The faster rise “reflects the fact that the biggest immediate problem at the moment for the end user is diesel” said Neil Crosby senior oil analyst at OilX. Other countries including the US and Germany have also seen sharply rising diesel prices. The world faces a diesel shortage Diesel supplies were tight before the crisis began as demand for oil bounced back after pandemic lockdowns faster than producers could keep up. “Stocks of lots of fuels are relatively low but diesel in particular in Europe in the US and in Asia as well. The demand for diesel has been very strong up until the crisis and that also contributed to that. There’s just an imbalance between supply and demand said OilX’s Mr Crosby. Finding alternative supplies to replace the diesel Britain buys from Russia will be made harder because many other countries around the world are also trying to wean themselves off Russian energy supplies at the same time. There is no suggestion of pumps in the UK imminently running dry. But last week the boss of one of the world’s biggest trading groups warned of possible diesel shortages around the world. The diesel market is extremely tight and we\re possibly heading to stock-outs. Europe can probably afford to pay. The problem is what happens to Africa and Latin America Jeremy Weir the chief executive of Trafigura said on 22 March according to the Reuters news agency. Glencore and Scorpio Tankers declined to comment.]

Ukraine war could worsen crises in Yemen and Afghanistan,"While the world focuses on Ukraine, the UN warns humanitarian needs elsewhere are also growing.",Ukraine war could worsen crises in Yemen and Afghanistan By Imogen Foulkes BBC News Geneva Published 13 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE WFP Image caption The WFP estimates 20.7 million people in Yemen need humanitarian assistance in 2022 Don\t make us take food from children that are hungry to give to children that are starving pleads the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). Soaring food and fuel costs together with budget cuts in some traditional donor countries have forced the WFP to halve the amount of food it is giving to millions of people in Yemen Chad and Niger. In December 2021 the UN made a record appeal for $41bn (£31bn) to help 273 million people this year. As aid workers stress these are not people who will be made a bit more comfortable by help from the UN. They are people particularly children who will probably die without it. But that appeal was made before Russia invaded Ukraine. Both countries used to sell grain to the WFP. Back then Ukraine was a supplier not a country in need of humanitarian assistance as the WFPs Geneva director Annalisa Conte points out. Food shortages In the first month of the war the WFP reached a million people inside Ukraine. But its supply of Ukrainian grain destined to feed some of the hungriest on the planet has dried up. Meanwhile many African countries while not dependent on UN aid import grain from Ukraine. Somalia gets more than 60% of its grain from Ukraine and Russia while Eritrea gets nearly 97% of its wheat from Ukraine. They now have to bid against Europeans and North Americans on the international market in search of food. Jan Egeland former head of UN emergency relief and now with the Norwegian Refugee Council describes this as a catastrophe for the poorest parts of the world. They will starve he says. Selective aid? This March in the hope of reminding donors of the continued needs in Yemen and Afghanistan the UN launched emergency flash appeals. IMAGE SOURCE WFP Image caption Malnutrition is on the rise in Afghanistan UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that Afghans were selling their children and their body parts in order to feed their families. But the flash appeal for Afghanistan achieved about half of what the UN asked for. A similar appeal for Yemen which the UN says is the worlds worst humanitarian crisis got less than a third. What is the World Food Programme? How much aid is getting into Afghanistan? Although aid workers dont like to say it publicly there is an uneasy feeling that traditional donor countries in Europe who in recent weeks have raised record sums for Ukraine and offered tens of thousands of places in their homes for Ukrainian refugees are being somewhat selective about who they help. There is no question that vulnerable civilians in Ukraine deserve all our compassion and the outpouring of generosity that we have seen says Robert Mardini director general of the International Committee of the Red Cross. But he adds there is a long list of unresolved conflicts elsewhere that continue to unfold day in day out. The crises in Afghanistan Yemen and Syria among others have only got worse since the Ukraine war. Jan Egeland admits aid agencies feel overstretched underfunded overwhelmed like never before. Compassion for all The generosity towards Ukrainians who have fled their homes has been welcomed by the UN Refugee Agency. But aid workers also know that until quite recently many European countries among them Hungary and Poland were pushing Syrian refugees back across their borders. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption More than four million people have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries because of the Russian invasion The refugee agencys Shabia Mantoo thinks the Ukraine war could be an opportunity for the world to come to a better understanding of what it is to be a refugee or to be a neighbouring country like Lebanon Uganda or Turkey hosting hundreds of thousands of people. She hopes the countries now throwing their doors open to Ukrainian refugees will extend that solidarity that compassion to all others in a similar situation. Tough year ahead But even if this crisis does cause a surge in global solidarity aid agencies know this will be a very difficult year. The fact that Russia a permanent veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council is the aggressor in this latest war will probably make the delivery of aid more complicated. The UN needs co-operation between Russia and the West for example for cross-border deliveries to Syria. But this relationship is now in the deep freeze as Jan Egeland puts it. Meanwhile food and fuel prices are set to rise still further while wealthy countries are looking to balance their books after spending tens of billions on their Covid recovery programmes. Its a perfect storm aid workers say which shows once again that humanitarian aid is never a solution and usually only an inadequate sticking plaster on the gaping wound of war. Peace is the precondition to everything else says Annalisa Conte.]
Ukraine: The bride who fled to India from Kyiv with a coffee machine,"Anna Horodetska fled to India from Kyiv, with just a couple of T-shirts and a coffee machine.",Ukraine: The bride who fled to India from Kyiv with a coffee machine By Geeta Pandey BBC News Delhi Published 14 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE ANUBHAV BHASIN Image caption Anna and Anubhav married in an intimate ceremony on Sunday Last month as bombs rained down on Ukraines capital Kyiv Anna Horodetska locked up her rented apartment and fled to India carrying just a couple of T-shirts and a coffee machine - a wedding present from her grandmother. When the 30-year-old who worked in an IT company arrived at the Delhi airport on 17 March she was welcomed by Anubhav Bhasin the 33-year-old lawyer shed been dating for just over a year. As drummers beat out celebratory tunes Anubhav went down on one knee and proposed to her and placed a ring on her finger when she said yes. On Sunday the couple were married in an intimate ceremony in the Indian capital. Later this month they will register their wedding in court to make it legally valid. Anna\s one-year visa states the purpose of her India visit is to marry Anubhav Bhasin. The couple met in August 2019 by chance in a bar while she was on a solo trip to India. They exchanged numbers followed each other on Instagram and the rest as they say is history. Their relationship took shape over different continents separated by geography meeting plans disrupted by the pandemic quarantine rules and flight restrictions and finally the Russian invasion of Annas homeland. By the end of the 2019 we were talking a lot says Anubhav. In march 2020 Anna visited India again along with a girlfriend and Anubhav took them on a road trip to Agra - to see the Taj Mahal the monument of love - and the desert state of Rajasthan. IMAGE SOURCE ANUBHAV BHASIN Image caption Anubhav went down on one knee at the Delhi airport to propose to Anna As India went into a sudden lockdown he invited them to stay at his family home in Delhi. It was during that time that we grew very close we realised we liked each other. We now knew this was more than a fling. After she returned to Kyiv we kept in touch through daily video calls he says. Their next meeting in February 2021 in Dubai he adds was a pivotal moment in our relationship when we realised that we had to find a way to take it forward. Things moved fast after that - in August he visited her in Kyiv and in December she came back to India. On the last day of my visit Anubhav\s mother suggested we get married in March. We were discussing marriage at some point but it was surprising that it had come so soon. But I thought why not just go for it says Anna. Anubhav is Hindu and Anna is Christian so their wedding would have to be registered in court under a special law and the formalities could take more than a month says Anubhav. So the couple decided that she would come to India at March-end to start the process and move to India for good a few months later. IMAGE SOURCE ANUBHAV BHASIN Image caption Anna and Anubhav at their Delhi home with the coffee machine - the real hero of their love story But then came the war. We knew that diplomacy had failed but we still thought war could be averted says Anna. Many of us also believed that the attacks would be concentrated on the border and that Kyiv would be safe. But on 24 February I woke up to the sound of bombing and my first thought was Am I dreaming? Then I saw messages from Anubhav and others confirming that we were under attack she adds. Many of the people she knew started packing their belongings and friends advised her to do the same. As shelling intensified the next day she moved to a bunker with her mother and her dog. It was filled with people. There was a curfew and we weren\t allowed to leave the bunker but I had to go out to breathe and walk the dog. The city was filled with the smell of smoke and the sky was so red she says. The girl who wouldn’t leave Ukraine without her dog Indian student killed in Ukraine as he bought food Days before Russia started bombing Ukraine Anubhav had been asking her to leave because he felt war was imminent but Anna was reluctant to leave without her dog. But on the morning of 26 February when she decided to leave Anubhav tried to dissuade her. By then things had become really bad he says. There was frequent shelling and the train station was far away and there were no taxis to take them. I was scared that she would be out on the street and there was a lot that could go wrong. So I told her it would be safer to stay in the bunker. But the next morning she found a taxi and managed to reach the station. After putting her mother and her dog on a train to her grandmothers village she boarded a train to Lviv on the western border. The trip out of Ukraine took her first to Slovakia then to Poland - where she waited for two weeks while Anubhav worked with the Indian embassy to organise her visa - and finally to Helsinki in Finland for her flight to Delhi. I couldn\t sleep a wink on the flight. I was stressed out. Even though we weren\t flying over the conflict zone I was worried that the plane might get hit by a rogue missile and we would crash. IMAGE SOURCE ANNA HORODETSKA Image caption Anna says once the war is over she will go back to Kyiv to pick up her dog On the morning of 17 March when she landed in Delhi there was a text waiting for her from Anubhav - it said he was running a bit late. I was super annoyed she told me. I was exhausted. I just wanted to go home and sleep. But when I came out he was there with music and balloons. As a dozen of Anubhavs friends cheered many strangers joined in clapping and filming a scene that seemed straight out of a Hollywood romance. I had not expected this because Anubhav is generally a very practical person but it was a pleasant surprise for sure says Anna. As the couple now get married and start a new life together Anna says once the war is over she will return to Kyiv to wrap up things and pick up my dog. In their heart-warming love story though they say the real hero is the coffee machine. A few months back when I told my grandmother about my wedding plans she gave me some money for a present says Anna. Since Anubhav loves his espressos I decided to buy us a coffee machine. And when I left Kyiv I had to bring it with me. Anubhav was saying don\t bother we\ll get one here but in my head I was thinking if I couldn\t go home soon then what would happen? Adds Anubhav: Anna is a trained make-up artist but she left behind her really expensive make-up to bring this coffee machine here. I think this machine is the real hero of our love story.

"Ukraine war: UK will not rest until justice is done, says Johnson","Boris Johnson says mass graves being found was ""sickening"" and those responsible must be held to account.",Ukraine war: UK will not rest until justice is done says Johnson By Malu Cursino BBC News Published 4 April comments Comments Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said we will not rest until justice is done amid further evidence of continued atrocities in Ukraine. Distressing images of civilian bodies in the streets of Bucha near Kyiv have led to international outrage over Russias actions. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has called for Russia to be suspended from the United Nations Human Rights Council. She has also pushed for tougher international sanctions on Russia. In a news conference in the Polish capital Warsaw Ms Truss said: What we have seen in the streets of Irpin and Bucha are scenes that we will never forget. We have seen butchery evidence of rape and sexual violence as well as the indiscriminate killing of civilians. She added: We are clear that after these appalling crimes Russia has no place on the Human Rights Council. A senior Westminster source has told the BBC the government is considering further action against Russian soldiers as individuals. Officials are looking at further sanctions that could target captains majors and colonels in the Russian military. It is understood this additional pressure could also include looking at ways to hold Russian soldiers legally accountable. Civilians massacred near Kyiv: What we know so far Could Putin be prosecuted for war crimes? Fact-checking Russian claims about Bucha killings Mr Johnson has said the UK will not stand by whilst this indiscriminate and unforgivable slaughter takes place. He added: We are working to ensure those responsible are held to account. We will not rest until justice is done. Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of 410 civilians have been found in the areas around Kyiv so far. Russia without evidence has said the photos and videos were a staged performance by Ukraine. Ms Truss reiterated the prime minister\s comments saying that the UK will not rest until these criminals are brought to justice. She said it\s very clear war crimes have taken place and the UK is taking the maximum approach on sanctions nothing is off the table. Ms Truss added that Nato needs to use a meeting this week to step up support and sanctions. She said these measures should include more countries banning Russian ships from ports sanctions on more banks and other sectors. In addition to this she said countries should set out a clear timetable for eliminating Russia energy use.

Also speaking at the news conference in Warsaw Mr Kuleba said: What you have seen the horrors that we have seen in Bucha are just the tip of the iceberg of all the crimes that have been committed by the Russian army in the territory of Ukraine so far. The foreign secretary will also hold talks with her Polish counterpart Zbigniew Rau on Tuesday. She has pledged a £10m civil society fund for Ukraine including support for organisations dealing with sexual violence following reports of Russian forces sexually assaulting people in Ukraine as a way of terrorising the population. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Liz Truss gave a news briefing with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba in Warsaw Ms Truss has said Russia\s President Vladimir Putin is yet to show he is serious about diplomacy. She said a tough approach from the UK and our allies is vital to strengthen Ukraine\s hand in negotiations. She added the UK would do more to ramp up the pressure on Russia and keep pushing others to do more. The BBCs Reality Check team and BBC Monitoring have been investigating Russias claims about the killings carried out in Bucha. Ukraine has accused Russia of deliberate massacre but Russia has crticised a staged provocation by Ukraine. The Kremlin claims the evidence seen by the BBC and several news outlets is inaccurate on three grounds: The staged video shows fake dead bodies in Bucha The bodies that are dead have not stiffened Not a single local resident has suffered from any violent action Media caption Debunking Russian claims about Bucha killings On Sunday Mr Johnson said Russia\s despicable attacks on innocent Ukrainian civilians in Bucha and Irpin were yet more evidence of war crimes. US President Joe Biden has repeatedly called Mr Putin a war criminal and has recently said he should face a trial over the killings in Bucha. Mr Biden said he was also seeking more sanctions against Russia over the atrocities. Mr Johnson spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky over the weekend. Following their conversation on Saturday evening Mr Zelensky said there would be a new package of very very tangible support. THE GREATEST BOXER IN HISTORY: The incredible life of Muhammad Ali...

South Yorkshire circus performers caught up in Ukraine war,Many members of South Yorkshire's Circus Cortex troupe are Ukrainian and are now trapped there.,South Yorkshire circus performers caught up in Ukraine war Published 20 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE CIRCUS CORTEX Image caption Many of South Yorkshire-based Circus Cortexs performers have been caught up in the Ukraine war A Yorkshire-based circus troupe has been forced to delay its latest tour of the UK after many of its performers were caught up in the war in Ukraine. More than 80% of South Yorkshires Circus Cortex are Ukrainian. Boss Irina Archer said suspension of UK work visas and the conscription of men into Ukraines military had stopped some members returning to the UK. Ms Archer who said she was half-Ukrainian and half-Russian described the war as unbearable. She said the performers had gone home over the winter to see their families and to renew their work visas and were then trapped when Russia invaded Ukraine in February. The Home Office had since frozen work visa applications from people in Ukraine Ms Archer added. Just unbearable She said he had kept in touch via messaging and video chats with some of the troupes performers stuck in Ukraine. One man who performed as a clown for Circus Cortex had been drafted into the Ukrainian army and was now using his talents to entertain children in the breaks between fighting Ms Archer said. On the day the Russian invasion started Ms Archer said she watched in disbelief as her circus artists in Ukraine texted her to say the war was under way. The whole thing is just unbearable she said. The fact that Russia are involved in Ukraine is like the mum is fighting with dad. Nearly every Russian has Ukrainian relatives one way or another. They managed to co-exist up until 2014 without any problems. Image caption Irina Archer said she hoped 12 Ukrainian performers would be joining the UK-based circus The circus had since found 12 alternative Ukrainian performers around the world who had already escaped the country she added. They were now heading for the UK under the Home for Ukraine scheme which allows UK families to sponsor Ukrainian refugees and provides a place for them to live. Ms Archer said she was personally taking in four people and following a post on social media several families in South Yorkshire would be housing the others. Using the Home for Ukraine scheme would also protect those performers who would be unable to return to their war-torn homeland after the circus tour ended she added. We think the fair thing for them to do is have the same visa all the other refugees are having Ms Archer said. The latest government figures show that 98 sponsorship visas have so far been issued in South Yorkshire. The Circus Cortex UK tour which was due to start on 8 April is now expected to start in Sheffield on 25 May. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook Twitter and Instagram.

Ukraine war: Desperate mother writes details on toddler's back,Sasha Makoviy wrote her daughter's name on her skin in case her family were killed fleeing Kyiv.,Ukraine war: Desperate mother writes details on toddlers back Published 15 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE SASHA MAKOVIY A mother who scrawled contact details on her two-year-old daughters back while fleeing Ukraine has described to the BBC her desperation in that moment. Sasha Makoviy said she wrote little Viras name age and some phone numbers on her in case the family were separated or killed while fleeing Kyiv. In case of our death she could be found and would know who she is Ms Makoviy explained. The family are now in France where they feel surrounded with love and care. After arriving Ms Makoviy posted a photo of the writing on Viras back to Instagram and the image has since gone viral. It was the first day of the war and we were preparing everything to flee from Kyiv and I was just not sure if it was safe Ms Makoviy told The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4. Packing their belongings under the sound of falling bombs and with little information available she said she wasn\t sure if we would come outside our house and be attacked by rockets. It was my biggest fear that Vira gets lost or that we become dead and she never finds out who she is or what family she is from Ms Makoviy said. IMAGE SOURCE SASHA MAKOVIY Image caption Sasha Makoviy holds her two year old daughter Vira at their home in Kyiv last Christmas Worried that her daughter might live but have no surviving family members Ms Makoviy hoped that at least Vira would one day be able to look up her mothers social media accounts to know what she looked like. I thought that she can find some information from the internet maybe find my account on Instagram - and maybe she could see her parents she said. Having finally reached the safety of France after a long escape through Moldova Romania and Belgium Ms Makoviy says she is mentally crushed. The war was so traumatic she says that simply walking outside is frightening because she mistakes stones for landmines. Vira is fine. She is too small to understand what is going on. She can feel something from me but she is too small to understand. I\m really happy about her age. Really happy.

What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion?,Western nations have imposed severe sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.,What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion? Published 21 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES The US and UK governments have announced further sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. The financial measures designed to damage Russias economy and penalise President Putin high-ranking officials and people who have benefited from his regime. What are sanctions? Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another to stop it acting aggressively or breaking international law. They are among the toughest actions nations can take short of going to war. What are the latest sanctions to be imposed? Among the USs latest sanctions are: economic measures to ban new investment in Russia severe sanctions on two Russian financial institutions - Alfa Bank and Sberbank sanctions on critical major state-owned enterprises sanctions on Russian government officials and their family members including President Putins adult children and relatives of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Meanwhile the UK has imposed sanctions on Russias largest bank Sberbank and committed to ending all imports of Russian coal and oil by the end of 2022. What else has been sanctioned? Military goods and mercenaries A ban on the export of dual-use goods - items with both a civilian and military purpose such as vehicle parts - has been imposed by the UK EU and US. The UK is also imposing sanctions on Russias Wagner Group - a private military firm thought to function as an arms-length unit of the Russian military. Flights All Russian flights have been banned from US UK EU and Canadian airspace. The UK has also banned private jets chartered by Russians. Luxury goods The UK and the EU have banned the export of luxury goods to Russia - including vehicles high-end fashion and art. The UK has also imposed a 35% tax on some imports from Russia including vodka. Targeting individuals The US EU and UK have together sanctioned more than 1000 Russian individuals and businesses including wealthy business leaders - so-called oligarchs - who are considered close to the Kremlin. One high-profile oligarch sanctioned by the UK is Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich. IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption Roman Abramovich was attempting to sell Chelsea FC Assets belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov are also being frozen in the US EU UK and Canada. The UK has also stopped the sale of golden visas which allowed wealthy Russians to get British residency rights. The hunt for superyachts of sanctioned Russians Will new legal powers find Putins loot? Oil and gas The US is banning all Russian oil and gas imports and the UK will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. The EU which gets a quarter of its oil and 40% of its gas from Russia says it will switch to alternative supplies and make Europe independent from Russian energy well before 2030. Germany has put on hold permission for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to open. Could the world survive without Russian oil and gas? Financial measures Western countries have frozen the assets of Russias central bank to stop it using its $630bn (£470bn) of foreign currency reserves. This caused the value of the rouble to slump by 22% which has pushed up the price of imported goods and led to a 14% rise in Russias rate of inflation. The rouble has since recovered - but largely due to measures to prop up the currency. Buyers of Russian gas have to pay in roubles and Moscow now requires Russian firms to convert most of their foreign profits into roubles. The United States has barred Russia from making debt payments using the $600m it holds in US banks making it harder for Russia to repay its international loans. Credit ratings agency S&P has now declared Russia to be in selective default (this means a debtor has defaulted on a specific obligation but not its entire debt) after it attempted to make interest payments on roubles for two dollar-denominated bonds. The agency said this was because investors were unlikely to be able to convert the roubles into dollars. Some Russian banks are being removed from the international financial messaging system Swift which is used to transfer money across borders. This will delay payments to Russia for energy exports. Other UK sanctions include: major Russian banks excluded from the UK financial system all Russian banks have had their assets frozen the Russian state and major companies cannot raise finance or borrow money in the UK a limit placed on deposits Russians can make at UK banks The EU also said it would target 70% of the Russian banking market and key state-owned firms. What are companies doing? A growing number of international companies including McDonalds Coca-Cola and Starbucks have suspended trading in Russia. After facing fierce criticism for continuing to operate in Russia Nestle has withdrawn some of its brands including KitKat and Nesquik but will still sell essential foods. However a number of other Western brands including Marks and Spencer Burger King and hotel groups Marriott and Accor say they cant pull out from Russia because their businesses there operate under complex franchise deals. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia Who has expelled Russian diplomats? Following the release of images of mass killings in Bucha Germany announced it would expel 40 Russian diplomats. Foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said the images showed unbelievable brutality on the part of the Russian leadership and those who follow its propaganda. France announced it would expel 35 Russian diplomats. Lithuania expelled the Russian ambassador. These moves follow an earlier co-ordinated round of expulsions of Russian diplomats by several EU countries. So far nine EU countries and the US have together expelled over 250 Russian diplomats and embassy workers. How has Russia reacted to the sanctions and expulsions? Russia\s President Putin has said he will make unfriendly nations pay for their imports of Russian gas in roubles which would push up the value of the currency. Former president Dmitri Medvedev said Russia is planning retaliation for its diplomats being expelled. It will be symmetrical and destructive for bilateral relations he said. Russia has banned exports of more than 200 products until the end of 2022 including telecoms medical vehicle agricultural electrical equipment and timber. In addition it is blocking interest payments to foreign investors who hold government bonds and banning Russian firms from paying overseas shareholders. It has stopped foreign investors who hold billions of dollars worth of Russian stocks and bonds from selling them. Could Russia turn to China as sanctions bite?

Chris Bater claims it is unfair he is ineligible for the Homes for Ukraine Scheme because they are not strangers. This is because Mr Bater has taken them in under the Family Scheme. The government said it was reducing the financial burden for those hosting Ukrainian relatives by giving them access to work study and benefits. Financial help Mr Bater who lives in Stoke Bishop with his wife Taisa revealed she was due to fly from Kyiv to Stansted the day after Russia invaded on 24 February. Believing that staying together would keep them safe Taisa had her two children daughter-in-law and three grandchildren move into her Kyiv flat. Just over a week later Taisa her daughter-in-law-and grandchildren caught a bus to Warsaw in Poland before eventually arriving in Bristol on 17 March. Her two adult children remain in the Ukrainian capital. Image caption Chris Bater and his wife Taisa with her Ukrainian relatives Getting them here under the Family Scheme did not qualify Mr Bater for the benefit despite him now having four extra people living in his house. Speaking to BBC Points West he said: It\s not a fair situation. We\re doing our best to help people leaving a country that has been ripped apart. He said that the government needs to assist people who are helping the refugees because the current scheme isn\t really working at the moment. Students want to tell Ukrainian refugees stories Siblings take on 10-day Drumathon for Ukraine Hundreds support Ukraine in march through Bristol A government spokesperson said the Homes for Ukraine and Ukraine Family schemes are one of the fastest and biggest visa programmes in UK history.

The BBC has heard first-hand testimony and found evidence of Ukrainian women being raped by invading soldiers. Warning: This report contains graphic descriptions of sexual violence In a quiet rural neighbourhood 70km (45miles) west of Kyiv we spoke to Anna who is 50. We have changed her name to protect her identity. Anna told us that on 7 March she had been at home with her husband when a foreign soldier barged in. At gunpoint he took me to a house nearby. He ordered me: \Take your clothes off or I\ll shoot you.\ He kept threatening to kill me if I didn\t do as he said. Then he started raping me she said. Anna described her attacker as a young thin Chechen fighter allied with Russia. While he was raping me four more soldiers entered. I thought that I was done for. But they took him away. I never saw him again she said. She believes she was saved by a separate unit of Russian soldiers. Anna went back home and found her husband. He had been shot in the abdomen. He had tried to run after me to save me but he was hit by a round of bullets she said. They both sought shelter in a neighbour\s house. They couldn\t take her husband to hospital because of the fighting. He died of his injuries two days later. Anna never stopped crying while telling us her story. She showed us where she and her neighbours buried her husband in the backyard of their home. A tall wooden cross stands at the head of the grave. Anna told us that she is in contact with the local hospital and is receiving psychological support. Image caption Anna has buried her husband in the garden The soldiers who saved her stayed in her house for a few days. She says they would point their gun at her and ask her to give them her husbands belongings. When they left I found drugs and Viagra. They would get high and they were often drunk. Most of them are killers rapists and looters. Only a few are OK she said. Down the road from Annas house we heard another chilling story. A woman was allegedly raped and killed and neighbours say it was done by the same man who raped Anna before he went to Annas house. The woman was in her 40s. She was taken out of her home say neighbours and held in the bedroom of a house nearby whose occupants had evacuated when the war began. The well-decorated room with ornate wallpaper and a bed with a golden headboard is now a disturbing crime scene. There are large bloodstains on the mattress and duvet. In a corner is a mirror with a note written in lipstick appearing to suggest where the victim was buried. Image caption The message scrawled on the mirror by Russian soldiers Oksana a neighbour told us it had been left there by Russian soldiers who found the woman\s body and buried her. They Russian soldiers] told me she had been raped and that her throat was either slit or stabbed and she bled to death. They said there was a lot of blood. The woman was buried in a grave in the garden of the house. A day after we visited the police exhumed her body to investigate the case. The body was found without clothes and with a deep long cut across the neck. Andrii Nebytov the police chief of the Kyiv region told us about another case theyre investigating in a village 50km (30 miles) to the west of Kyiv. A family of three - a couple in their thirties and their young child - lived in a house on the edge of the village. On 9 March several soldiers of the Russian army entered the house. The husband tried to protect his wife and child. So they shot him in the yard said Mr Nebytov. After that two soldiers repeatedly raped the wife. They would leave and then come back. They returned three times to rape her. They threatened that if she resisted they would harm her little boy. To protect her child she didn\t resist. When the soldiers left they burnt down the house and shot the familys dogs. Image caption The familys burned out house The woman escaped with her son and then contacted the police. Mr Nebytov says his team has met her and recorded her testimony. They have been gathering evidence at the family home - only its shell is now left. Just a few signs of a previous peaceful ordinary life lie in the charred ruins. We saw a childs bicycle a stuffed horse a dogs leash and a mans fur lined winter shoe. The husband was buried in the garden by neighbours. The police have now exhumed his body for examination. They plan to take the case to international courts. Ukraines ombudsman for human rights Lyudmyla Denisova says theyre documenting several such cases. About 25 girls and women aged 14 to 24 were systematically raped during the occupation in the basement of one house in Bucha. Nine of them are pregnant she said. Russian soldiers told them they would rape them to the point where they wouldn\t want sexual contact with any man to prevent them from having Ukrainian children. Image caption A childs toy outside the burned-out family home She says they are receiving several calls on support helplines - and also getting information through channels on the Telegram messaging app. A 25-year-old woman called to tell us her 16-year-old sister was raped in the street in front of her. She said they were screaming \This will happen to every Nazi prostitute\ as they raped her sister Ms Denisova said. We asked if it was possible to assess the scale of sexual crimes committed by Russian troops during the occupation. It is impossible at the moment because not everyone is willing to tell us what happened to them. The majority of them currently call for psychological support so we cannot record those as crimes unless they give us their testimony Ms Denisova said. She says Ukraine wants a special tribunal to be set up by the United Nations to try Vladimir Putin personally for allegations of war crimes including rape. I want to ask Putin why is this happening? said Anna the woman who told us she was raped. I don\t understand. We\re not living in the Stone Age why can\t he negotiate? Why is he occupying and killing?

Cryptocurrency: UK Treasury to regulate some stablecoins,"Treasury Minister John Glen says ""stablecoins"" could be used as a means of payment.",Cryptocurrency: UK Treasury to regulate some stablecoins By Michael Race and Daniel Thomas Business reporters BBC News Published 4 April comments Comments Share Media caption What is cryptocurrency and how does it work? The Treasury has announced that it will regulate some cryptocurrencies as part of a wider plan to make the UK a hub for digital payment companies. So-called stablecoins will become recognised forms of payment to give people confidence in using digital currencies it said. Stablecoins are designed to have a stable value linked to traditional currencies or assets like gold. They are considered less volatile than cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. The Treasury also said it planned to consult on regulating a much wider range of digital currencies later this year without saying which they might be. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: We want to see the cryptocurrency] businesses of tomorrow - and the jobs they create - here in the UK and by regulating effectively we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long-term. The Treasury has not yet confirmed which stablecoins will be regulated; well-known ones include Tether and Binance USD. Stablecoins are currently used in the United States to facilitate trading lending or borrowing of other digital assets. What is cryptocurrency and how does it work? Why is the richest man in the world talking about Bitcoin? However they are not without controversy. Tether a Hong Kong based company has faced questions over its business practices and was fined $41m in 2021 by the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission for allegedly misstating its reserves. The UK\s Treasury said regulating stablecoins would ensure they could be used safely by the public. Cryptocurrencies are virtual or digital currencies that can be traded or used to buy goods and services although not many shops accept them yet and some countries have banned them altogether. They are exchanged via peer-to-peer transactions meaning there are no banks or other third parties involved. Wild fluctuation in the value of some digital currencies has led regulators to warn they pose risks. However they are increasingly going mainstream with major financial companies now investing in them. Meanwhile Tesla founder Elon Musk the richest person in the world has voiced his support for virtual currencies and said Bitcoin is a good thing. NFTs Separately the Treasury said it will ask The Royal Mint to create a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) this summer. NFTs are assets in the digital world that can be bought and sold but which have no tangible form of their own. The digital tokens which emerged in 2014 can be thought of as certificates of ownership for virtual or physical assets. NFTs have a unique digital signature which means they cannot be copied or replicated. UK Financial Services Minister John Glen said the UK saw enormous potential in crypto and had a detailed plan for] harnessing the potential of blockchain and supporting the development of a world-best crypto ecosystem. What does the future of crypto here in the UK look like? No-one knows for sure he said in a speech. But we think that by making this country a hospitable place for crypto we can attract investment and] generate swathes of new jobs. Financial and environmental concerns Regulators are racing to draw up rules to manage cryptocurrencies amid concern that their growing popularity could threaten established financial systems. In December the Bank of Englands deputy governor said that while only about 0.1% of UK wealth was currently held as digital assets that proportion was growing quickly. Sir Jon Cunliffe told the BBC that if the value of cryptocurrencies fell sharply it could have a knock-on effect. Meanwhile the US is moving to craft regulations amid rising concern that the cryptocurrency industry is a haven for criminals. The process of generating digital coins via banks of powerful computers called mining is also highly energy intensive. Recent research suggests Bitcoin now generates carbon emissions comparable to the country of Greece. Mr Glen admitted there were concerns about the environmental impact and said the government will be looking closely at energy usage associated with certain crypto-technologies.]
Ukraine round-up: Austria pessimistic after Putin talks,"Russia warns two Nordic nations against Nato membership, and the Austrian chancellor meets Putin in Moscow.",Ukraine round-up: Austria pessimistic after Putin talks Published 17 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption A pro-Russian soldier standing near a burnt out building in the city of Mariupol yesterday on 10 April After suffering some of the worst fighting in Ukraines conflict could the port city of Mariupol be about to fall to Russia? A brigade fighting in the city said they could be facing a last battle and that they would soon have to choose between Russian captivity and death. But the exact picture of what is happening in the city is unclear. Mariupol\s deputy mayor called the reports fake and said Ukraine\s forces were holding out. Mariupols defence against Russian occupation has turned the city into a national symbol of resistance. IMAGE SOURCE . The port city - which Russian forces have tried and failed to capture fully since the beginning of the war - is critical for Moscow as it would establish a land corridor between Russian-occupied Crimea and the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. For weeks Russian troops have cut off essential supplies into Mariupol bombarding its buildings and blocking survivors from escaping. The battle for Mariupol can be seen as part of Russias shift in focus to eastern Ukraine. Heres how Russias attack may play out. Russia warns Finland and Sweden on Nato membership IMAGE SOURCE ANADOLU AGENCY Image caption For years the Kremlin has fiercely opposed any expansion of the Nato Western military alliance which it views as a threat to Russian influence in Europe Responding to the news that the two Nordic neighbours could apply for Nato membership - Russia says any enlargement of the Western military alliance would not result in more stability. Further Nato] expansion will not bring additional security to the European continent Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said to reporters. Russians disapproval is no surprise: for decades Moscow has opposed any more European countries joining the alliance. But Russias invasion of Ukraine has prompted Finland and Sweden to seriously consider asking for membership which comes with security guarantees that Ukraine as a non-member didnt have. Austria chancellor downbeat after meeting Putin IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer visited Moscow after travelling to Kyiv over the weekend The face-to-face meeting is the first to have been held between a Western leader and President Putin since the invasion began. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer says he went to the Russian capital to confront Putin with the facts but didnt leave with a positive impression. If you\re asking me whether I am optimistic or pessimistic I\m rather pessimistic he said adding there was little interest on the Russian side about a direct meting between Mr Putin and the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. For his part President Zelensky was asked whether he would hand over any part of Ukraine to Russia. He said he was not ready for that but accepted it would be part of any discussion. Media caption Watch: Zelensky asked if hell give Russia any of Ukraine Who are Putins Facebook superfans? IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Millions of social media users are viewing posts portraying Russian president Vladimir Putin as smiling benevolent and peace-loving. But a joint BBC investigation into ten pro-Putin Facebook groups found that many of their most active posters were actually duplicate accounts. It\s an example of pro-Kremlin astroturfing an online tactic designed to create the impression that a movement has more support than it does. Russian protester hired by German media IMAGE SOURCE AFP Marina Ovsyannikova the editor who was detained and fined after holding an anti-war protest during a live broadcast on Russian state television last month has a new role. The 43-year-old journalist has been hired as a correspondent by the company which owns Die Welt newspaper. Ms Ovsyannikova will be reporting for the outlet from Ukraine and Russia - she previously said that despite fearing for her safety she would not leave Russia.

"Mariupol: Battle for key port city continues, Ukraine says",Mariupol's deputy mayor denies reports that Russia is close to victory in his city.,Mariupol: Battle for key port city continues Ukraine says Published 20 hours ago comments Comments Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Mariupol has been burned to ashes Ukraine\s president claims Ukrainian forces are holding out against Russia in the southern port city of Mariupol officials say despite some reports suggesting the battle was nearing its end. Deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov told the BBC that battles for Mariupol continue. He also denied reports about a marine brigade which posted to Facebook about running out of ammunition and facing a last battle. The information about the marines is fake. I don\t comment on fakes. The Russians temporarily occupied part of the city. Ukrainian soldiers continue defending the central and southern parts of the city as well as industrial areas and so on Mr Orlov said. In a Facebook post Ukrainian armed forces Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi said the military still had stable open lines of communication with its soldiers inside the city. The military is doing the possible and impossible to save lives and fight against Russian forces he wrote. Mariupol lies between the pro-Russia breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in the east and annexed Crimea in the south. Seizing the city has been a major goal of the Russian offensive. Western officials are warning that this is an incredibly important window for vital support to Ukraine as Russia prepares to double or triple the number of troops it has in the country\s eastern Donbas region. In briefings officials say Russia is re-equipping its combat units and adding fresh troops - which will take time. In the meantime Western economic and military aid for Ukraine could prove valuable in preparing for any renewed offensive. Why Mariupol is so important to Russias plan Thousands of Mariupol civilians taken to Russia Evacuees recount terror of Mariupol assault Meanwhile Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelensky said that tens of thousands of people had likely been killed in Mariupol. The BBC has not verified the figure but reports from the region and the refugees fleeing the city spoke of bodies lying in the streets and most buildings damaged or destroyed. The last battle The 36th marine brigade earlier posted on Facebook warning that after 47 days of defending the city the unit had been surrounded by the Russian army and was facing hand-to-hand combat. The post - which Mr Orlov labelled a fake - promised Ukrainians its soldiers did everything possible and impossible to stop the Russian advance. Today will probably be the last battle as the ammunition is running out... it\s death for some of us and captivity for the rest it said. It also complained about a lack of support from other parts of the Ukrainian military with aid promised which never came. The post said the marines have been pushed back to the Azovmash factory in the city. It is believed there is also fighting inside the Azovstal industrial zone which is on the coast. Some experts expressed scepticism about the post suggesting that the Facebook page could have been hacked by Russian operatives. But others are sure that it is authentic. Mariupol has seen little let-up in the fighting since the war began with little humanitarian aid long delays to evacuations and reports of civilians starving or being forcibly removed to Russia-held territory. The head of pro-Russia Donetsk separatists Denis Pushilin told Russian media that he thought more than 5000 people may have been killed though he blamed Ukrainian forces. Russian forces have continued to slowly advance and seize more of the city in recent weeks - unlike in the rest of Ukraine where they have refocused military action around the breakaway regions in the east largely pulling out of other areas such as near the capital Kyiv. As a result Ukrainian officials are focusing on evacuating civilians from eastern towns and cities in anticipation of a renewed assault in some places. Nine new humanitarian corridors have been agreed between Ukraine and Russia to allow civilians to flee including from Mariupol. Ukraine is also putting on extra trains to extract people from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions where Russia is focusing its efforts. Mr Zelensky said that tens of thousands of pro-Russian troops are believed to have redeployed and massed in the area and a renewed offensive is widely expected to come soon.

Ukraine conflict: What is Nato and how has it responded to Russia's invasion?,Nato faces one of the biggest challenges in its history with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.,Ukraine conflict: What is Nato and how has it responded to Russias invasion? Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES The Nato military alliance could soon expand with both Finland and Sweden expected to apply for membership. Nato countries are currently supplying weapons ammunition and other military equipment to Ukraine following Russias invasion. What is Nato? Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - is a military alliance formed in 1949 by 12 countries including the US UK Canada and France. Members agree to come to one anothers aid in the event of an armed attack against any individual member state. Natos aim was originally to counter the threat of post-war Russian expansion in Europe. Soviet Russia responded by creating its own military alliance of eastern European communist countries called the Warsaw Pact. After the Soviet Unions collapse in 1991 a number of former Warsaw Pact countries joined Nato. Could Sweden and Finland join Nato? US officials expect Sweden and Finland to bid for membership as early as June. If they joined it would take the Nato alliance to 32 members. Russia has warned both countries against doing so But US defence officials said Moscow\s invasion of Ukraine has been a massive strategic blunder which is likely to bring about Nato enlargement. Why isnt Nato sending troops to Ukraine? Because Ukraine isnt a Nato member the alliance isnt obliged to come to the countrys defence. Nato countries fear if their troops confront Russian forces in Ukraine it could lead to an all-out conflict between Russia and the West. Nato says its members are determined to do all we can to support Ukraine but must ensure the war doesn\t escalate beyond Ukraine\s borders. This is why Nato rejected imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine. However it has approved sending four new battlegroups to Slovakia Hungary Bulgaria and Romania - three of which border Ukraine - doubling Natos presence in the region. Why is Russia opposed to Nato? Nato offered Ukraine a path towards membership in 2008. After Russias annexation of Crimea in 2014 Ukraine made joining a priority. But this hasnt happened mainly because of Russias long-standing opposition. One of Russias demands before the invasion was that Ukraine should never be allowed to join - something Nato refused to accept. Russia fears Nato is encroaching on its area of political influence by taking on new members from eastern Europe and that admitting Ukraine would bring Nato into its backyard. Ukraine\s President Zelensky has accepted his country can\t join Nato at present saying: It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of Nato. We understand this. China joins Russia in opposing Nato expansion Which weapons have the UK and other countries sent to Ukraine? Initially Nato countries limited their supplies to defensive weapons - such as handheld anti-tank or anti-aircraft missiles and ammunition. Now several member states are supplying Ukraine with more sophisticated equipment to enable Ukraines army to push back against Russias army. Slovakia has sent its S-300 anti aircraft defence system - this can attack aircraft up to 400km away The Czech Republic has sent T72 tanks and armoured infantry carriers The UK and Australia are sending armoured vehicles Germany is considering sending tanks and other armoured vehicles but has not reached a decision Ahead of a recent Nato meeting in Brussels the UK said it would provide 6000 new defensive missiles and £25m to help Ukraine pay its armed forces. The UK has already supplied over 4000 shoulder-mounted NLAW anti-tank missiles and some Starstreak missiles. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption A Ukrainian soldier holding a Javelin anti-tank missile system during exercises in 2021 It has also given body armour helmets and boots. In addition the UK has deployed Sky Sabre a long-range air defence system to Poland along with 100 military personnel to operate it. The US initially sent $200m (£152m) and then a further $350m (£267m) of weapons. This included Javelin missiles Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and body armour. The US has since announced a $1bn (£760m) security aid package. This includes more sophisticated longer-range weapons such as Switchblade anti-tank drones. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Nato has stepped up its military defences in eastern Europe The EU has said it will spend up to 450m euros (£376m) to fund the supply of weapons to Ukraine. It is the first time in its history that the EU has helped provide arms for a warzone. The Netherlands Belgium Poland Estonia Latvia and Slovakia are among those also sending military equipment including ammunition fuel and rations. Are arms shipments to Ukraine making a difference? How many troops does Nato have in Eastern Europe? Even before the latest deployments are agreed Nato already had troops stretching from the Baltic republics in the north to Romania in the south. They were stationed there in 2014 after Russia\s annexation of Crimea and are designed to act as a tripwire in case of a Russian attack. Nato has sent elements of its 40000-strong Response Force to Eastern European countries bordering Russia and Ukraine. It has 100 fighter jets on high alert and 120 ships including three carrier groups patrolling the seas from the far north to the eastern Mediterranean. The US has committed to sending more troops to Europe - joining the existing four multinational battlegroups Nato has in Estonia Latvia Lithuania and Poland and its multinational brigade in Romania.]

Ukraine conflict: Why is Russia losing so many tanks?,Russia is thought to have lost more than 400 tanks in Ukraine during the current conflict.,Ukraine conflict: Why is Russia losing so many tanks? Published 23 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption A Ukrainian soldier on a destroyed Russian tank near Kyiv It is thought that Russia has lost hundreds of tanks within two months of invading Ukraine. Military experts put the losses down to the advanced anti-tank weapons which western nations have given to Ukraine and to the poor way Russia has used its tanks. How great are Russias tanks losses? Ukraines armed forces say Russia has lost more than 680 tanks. Meanwhile Oryx - a military and intelligence blog which counts Russias military losses in Ukraine on the basis of photographs sent from the war zone - says Russia has lost more than 460 tanks and over 2000 other armoured vehicles. According to the Rand Corporation and the IISS (International Institute for Strategic Studies) Russia had about 2700 main battle tanks in total at the start of the conflict. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Javelin missiles have destroyed dozens of Russian tanks How effective have anti-tank weapons been? The US supplied Ukraine with 2000 Javelin anti-tank missiles at the start of the conflict and has since sent at least 2000 more. Javelins can be fired so that the missile explodes on the top of a tank where the armour is weakest according to manufacturer Lockheed Martin. A lot of Russian tanks are fitted with reactive armour which absorbs the impact of missiles. However Javelins are fitted with two warheads. One blows away the reactive armour and the second pierces the chassis underneath. The UK has also sent at least 3600 Next Generation Light Anti-tank Weapon missiles (NLAW). These are also designed to explode as they pass over the relatively exposed turret top of tanks. Javelin and NLAW are very potent says Nick Reynolds research analyst in land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). Without this lethal aid the situation in Ukraine would be very different. The US is supplying Ukraine with 100 Switchblade anti-tank drones. Known as kamikaze drones they can hover over a target miles away from the operator and then drop on top of a tank destroying it with the warhead at their tip. What is Nato and how is it helping Ukraine? How much are Russian tactics to blame? Nowadays the Russian army operates through Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs) which are self-contained combat units made up of tanks infantry and artillery. The precise composition of these units may vary but generally they comprise a large number of armoured vehicles but relatively few infantry troops. Russia has relatively few troops to call on says Phillips O\Brien a professor of strategic studies at St Andrews University so BTGs are a way of creating a fighting unit with lots of punch. They\re designed to attack quickly with lots of firepower. However they have very little protection in terms of infantry personnel to escort them and to retaliate if the armoured column comes under attack he says. That makes the Russian army like a boxer who has a great right hook and a glass jaw. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption The top of the tank is its least protected part and that is the area modern missiles target Prof OBrien says a lack of Russian air patrols means Ukrainian troops have found it easy to get into positions to ambush Russian tank columns. Russia didn\t get air supremacy at the start of the conflict he says and so they cannot patrol the skies spotting Ukrainian army movements. That means Ukrainian troops have been able to get into good fire positions for ambushes and they have been able to do a lot of damage this way. Why has Putin invaded Ukraine - what does he want? What have been Russias military mistakes? How much is down to Russian incompetence? According to Oryxs figures half of the tanks Russia has lost have not been destroyed or damaged by the enemy but have been captured or abandoned. Experts put this down to logistical failures and incompetence by Russian troops. You\ve seen pictures of Russian tanks being dragged off by Ukrainian farmers\ tractors says Prof O\Brien. Some of those tanks were abandoned because they ran out of fuel. That\s a logistical failure. Some got stuck in the springtime mud because the high command invaded at the wrong time of year. Image caption Tractors tow away an abandoned missile launcher in Ukraine Russia\s ground forces are made up of a lot of conscripts and recruits. That makes them in world terms a low to medium-quality fighting force says RUSI\s Nick Reynolds. Many tanks have been abandoned because of bad driving. Some have been driven off bridges. Others have been driven into ditches so that the tracks have come off. The ability of the troops to use their equipment has been lacking. But often soldiers have simply abandoned their vehicles and fled. So the will to fight has also been lacking. The Ukrainian government has even issued instructions on how citizens should turn in abandoned military vehicles. Authorities also confirmed that anyone who found such combat trophies did not need to declare them for tax purposes.]
Former Wolverhampton hospital could house Ukrainian refugees,Developers want to convert Wolverhampton's Royal Hospital which closed in 1997.,Former Wolverhampton hospital could house Ukrainian refugees Published 21 hours ago Share IMAGE SOURCE JESSUP BROTHERS Image caption The main former Royal Hospital building in Wolverhampton closed in 1997 The former Royal Hospital in Wolverhampton could be turned into housing for Ukrainian refugees under plans submitted to the city council. The site closed in 1997 but was bought for residential development by the Homes and Communities Agency in 2016. Plans have now been drawn up to convert the former porters lodge and main hospital building into flats. Council planners are yet to make a final decision on the application which would be a temporary use for two years. If successful each residential unit could accommodate up to six people and the former hospital building would be turned into 38 flats comprising one and two-bedroomed apartments. The proposed development at the Cleveland Road site which is a conservation area follows several applications by other organisations to change the site all of which have not been approved. IMAGE SOURCE JESSUP BROTHERS Image caption The former nurses home remains as well the the main hospital and lodge A resolution to approve planning permission has previously been granted by the council however suggesting redevelopment will take place in the near future the Local Democracy reporting Service said. In a statement Russell Morriss from architects BPN which is working with developers Jessup Brothers said: Following the outbreak of war in Ukraine and the subsequent request by the government for people to provide asylum to Ukrainian refugees developers Jessup has appointed BPN Architects to develop proposals for converting the former lodge building into flats. This would be temporary use for two years. A heritage statement submitted with the application stated there had been a comprehensive site clearance with only the Grade II listed main hospital building the lodge and the former nurses home left. There is a need to protect the character of the conservation area by preserving and enhancing historic structures - particularly vacant buildings such as the hospital Bakers Boot & Shoe Factory and the Dixon building. Any new development should complement and integrate well with the character of the conservation area it said. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook Twitter and Instagram.

Ukraine War: Russia warns Sweden and Finland against Nato membership,Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the move won't bring stability to Europe.,Ukraine War: Russia warns Sweden and Finland against Nato membership Published 23 hours ago comments Comments Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned against Nato enlargement saying it would not aid European stability Russia has warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato arguing the move would not bring stability to Europe. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the alliance remains a tool geared towards confrontation. It comes as US defence officials said Moscow\s invasion of Ukraine has been a massive strategic blunder which is likely to bring Nato enlargement. US officials expect the Nordic neighbours to bid for membership of the alliance potentially as early as June. Washington is believed to support the move which would see the Western alliance grow to 32 members. US State Department officials said last week that discussions had taken place between Nato leaders and foreign ministers from Helsinki and Stockholm. Before it launched its invasion Russia demanded that the alliance agree to halt any future enlargement but the war has led to the deployment of more Nato troops on its eastern flank and a rise in public support for Swedish and Finnish membership. Finnish MPs are expected to receive a security report from intelligence officials this week and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said she expects her government will end the discussion before midsummer on whether to make a membership application. Finland shares a 1340km (830 miles) long border with Russia and has been rattled by the invasion of Ukraine. What is Nato and how is it helping Ukraine? And Swedens ruling Social Democratic party which has traditionally opposed Nato membership said it is rethinking this position in light of Russias attack on its western neighbour. Party secretary Tobias Baudin told local media that the Nato review should be complete within the next few months. When Russia invaded Ukraine Sweden\s security position changed fundamentally the party said in a statement on Monday. But Moscow has been clear that it opposes any potential enlargement of the alliance. Mr Peskov warned the bloc is not that kind of alliance which ensures peace and stability and its further expansion will not bring additional security to the European continent. Last week Mr Peskov said that Russia would have to rebalance the situation with its own measures were Sweden and Finland to join Nato. And in February Maria Zakharova Russia\s foreign ministry spokeswoman warned of military and political consequences if the countries joined the bloc. Nato was formed in 1949 to counter the threat of Soviet expansion though since the fall of the Berlin wall a number of formerly communist eastern European countries have joined. Member states agree to come to one anothers aid in the event of an armed attack against any individual member state. Despite the threats both countries have pushed ahead with their bids and stepped up defence spending. On Monday army leaders in Helsinki announced a new plan to allocate €14m (£10.88m) to purchase drones for Finlands military. And last month Swedish officials said they would boost defence spending by three billion kronas ($317m; £243m) in 2022.]

It joins a list that includes Malibu and Santa Cruz in California and the Gold Coast and Manly in Australia. The WSR recognises the quality of the surf as well as the sports importance to the wider community. The WSR programme was launched in 2009 in California with the aim of protecting surf ecosystems around the globe.

And an area around Braunton Burrows is a Unesco Biosphere for its landscapes wildlife areas and cultural heritage. The reserve covers about 30km (19 miles) of coastline. A WSR spokesperson said: Its high density of outstanding surf at iconic breaks such as Croyde Saunton Woolacombe and Lynmouth caters to wave-riders from beginner to expert and a variety of surfing styles. IMAGE SOURCE GORDON DRYBURGH Image caption Beautiful Woolacombe lights up under a blue sky: Reserve campaigners want to help influence decision makers IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption North Devon has joined the ranks of world-famous surf spots such as Malibu beach in Los Angeles North Devon surfer Kevin Cook who proposed making the area a surfing reserve said he hoped the new designation would help influence decision makers. We are about collaboration and taking existing good practice to keep an eye on what\s going on and ensure that the future of north Devon is protected he said. Water pollution was a key thing he said. It seems crazy to be pumping out gallons of sewage into the ocean and spoiling the beaches we have he said. Our water quality is good but it could be better and we need that extra spending on infrastructure by water companies to make sure we are not tarnishing the future. IMAGE SOURCE ROB TIBBLES Image caption Putsborough shows shape and power He also wanted to support projects to encourage wellbeing because there\s something very special about surfing. He said: Being in the water brings a special feeling you can\t experience anywhere else so it\s important for as many people to share it as possible. We are really excited about it north Devon is a very special place. Adam Hall co-founder of the surfing reserve in North Devon said: Our core focus is looking after the quality of the waves themselves and preserving the ecosystems that produce them. Surf spots need to be celebrated recognised and protected in the same way we protect and recognise beautiful national parks like Exmoor.

Liliia Rudenko 18 was at university in Kyiv before she was forced to flee when the Russian army began the bombardment on the edge of the city. She met Maureen Stewart 47 and her daughter Jordan 20 through a Facebook page for refugees and is now at their home in Linwood Renfrewshire. Liliia said their kindness was so good and it felt strange to arrive. Only weeks earlier she had been was listening to an online lecture when her friends came to her door and warned her that war had started. Visas for 566 Ukrainians to come to Scotland Super sponsor scheme opens for Ukrainian refugees She said: I heard bombs and I didn\t know what to do. I called my dad and he told me to come home because \we want you with us\. Usually it takes two hours but it took me six hours to get home. On her familys suggestion she travelled to Poland to find safety. Image caption Liliia is now living with Maureen and Jordan at their home in Linwood Renfrewshire In Poland she joined social media groups to talk to potential host families in the UK. She met Marueen and Jordan and the trio had nightly video chats for about four weeks. Liliia said talking to them made her feel welcome and like she needed to be here. Her visa vas granted as part of the UK governments Homes for Ukraine scheme which allows members of the public to host refugees. Maureen said they wanted to help after watching the conflict unfold on the news. She said: Realising how much people were suffering you had the feeling you had to do something. I don\t have a lot of money to donate but this is something we could do we had this space it\s empty it was being used as a junk room so to use it practically was something we really wanted to do. To help Liliia feel more comfortable in her new home  Jordan created a gift basket and Scottish playlist for the teenager. She just seemed to fit in this family Maureen added. Image caption Jordan made a welcome Scottish gift basket so Liliia would feel at home Meanwhile a dedicated NHS helpline has been launched to support Ukrainian refugees coming to Scotland. The Scottish government-backed helpline will support people displaced by the war to travel safely via the UK governments visa scheme. It will also provide information to local authorities councils and other agencies in advance of people arriving in Scotland in a bid to help them settle in more quickly. Martin Morrison operations director of NHS National Services Scotland said: Our national contact centre is well placed to respond to this crisis. Our team\s empathetic approach and first class service will hopefully make the lives of those who have been devastated by the war just that little bit easier. Last Friday it was confirmed visas have been granted for 566 Ukrainians to come to Scotland including 35 refugees whose applications have been approved under the Scottish governments super sponsor scheme.

2+2 India-US talks: Ukraine looms large over Modi-Biden meeting,The leaders are meeting under the shadow of their differing stands on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.,2+2 India-US talks: Ukraine looms large over Modi-Biden meeting By Vikas Pandey BBC News Delhi Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Mr Modi and Mr Biden have talked about strengthening India-US ties (file photo) Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden will hold virtual talks on Monday ahead of the meeting between their foreign and defence ministers in Washington. The ministers annual meeting - known as the 2+2 Dialogue - was launched in 2018 to deepen co-operation between the two countries. The forum has focused on improving bilateral relations and co-operation in Asia. It is also seen as part of Washingtons strategy to help India become a counterweight to China in the region. The two nations have largely been on the same page - at least in their public statements - on most issues of mutual concern. But its not business as usual this time because of Russias invasion of Ukraine. Delhi\s press release ahead of the talks included the usual line about strengthening the comprehensive global strategic partnership between the two countries. But Washington\s statement mentioned mitigating the destabilising impacts of Russia\s war against Ukraine suggesting that the US will again nudge India - perhaps not too hard - to take a stronger position on Moscow. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Indian defence minister Rajnath Singh left and foreign minister S Jaishankar are in Washington to hold talks India and the US have had differing views over Ukraine since the war began in February. While Delhi has used strong words to comment on the invasion it hasnt directly criticised Moscow. It has also abstained from all UN votes against Russia. India has also been trying to find ways to circumvent banking sanctions on Moscow to take advantage of discounted oil prices offered by Russian firms. Indias stand of non-alignment also stems from its own geopolitical needs. Moscow is Delhis time-tested ally and also its largest supplier of defence equipment - accounting for more than 50% of its imports. Confusion over Indias stand A former Indian diplomat said Delhis stand has put Washington in a Catch-22 situation. The US wants India to be part of its wider strategy of isolating Russia but at the same time it cant afford to weaken India against China - both diplomatically and militarily. Experts say this has created confusion in the White House about the best way to deal with India. Washington has not directly criticised India but has issued statements that experts call mild warnings. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption India and the US have had differing views over Ukraine since the war began After Mr Modi refrained from criticising Russia during a recent meeting of the Quad - which also includes Australia the US and Japan - on Ukraine Mr Biden said India\s stand on the war was somewhat shaky. His top economic adviser Brian Deese later said India had been informed that the consequences of a more explicit strategic alignment with Moscow would be significant and long-term. But this didnt deter India as it once against abstained from the vote that suspended Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. Other US officials including US Deputy National Security Adviser for International Economics Daleep Singh have appeared to be more understanding of Indias stand. Whats at stake? While Mr Biden and Mr Modi are likely to focus on bilateral ties Ukraine still looms large over the meeting. It will also be on the agenda when Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh meet their US counterparts Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin on Monday. Both sides have been clear about their differing stands on Ukraine but there is too much at stake to risk their bilateral relationship. Why India is not criticising Russia over Ukraine The China factor in Indias Quad strategy What Putins India visit means for world politics Washington sees India as an ally to challenge Chinas dominance in the Asia-Pacific region. Both countries also believe that there is massive untapped potential in bilateral trade. They have the ambitious target of taking bilateral trade - which was at $113bn in 2021 - to $500bn in the future. India also needs the US to help diversify its defence portfolio and reduce its reliance on Russian arms. Moscow continues to be Indias largest arms supplier even though its share has dropped to 49% from 70%. The US was Indias second-largest supplier between 2011 and 2015 after Russia but fell behind France and Israel in the period between 2016 and 2021. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Russia has sold its S-400 anti-aircraft system seen here in Crimea to India Both Washington and Delhi would want to improve on these statistics. The S-400 deal But the elephant in the room will continue to be Indias purchase of the S-400 missile defence system from Russia - a deal which gives India strategic deterrence against both China and Pakistan. The agreement has come under the Countering Americas Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa) which was introduced in 2017 to target Russia Iran and North Korea with economic and political sanctions. It also prohibits any country from signing defence deals with these nations. The US had sanctioned China for buying the same system in 2018. But so far it has been evasive about doing the same for India. It had refrained from sanctioning India even after the country started receiving the first deliveries of the S-400 in December last year. But the Ukraine war will now further complicate the situation. Some US officials have said in the past that there was no guarantee that India would get a waiver. Now in the fast-changing geopolitical scenario both Washington and Delhi would not want to publicly take stands against each other. But when the defence ministers meet the S-400 and the issue of sanctions will definitely come up. How the two countries deal with this and their other differences will determine the future course of Washington-Delhi ties.]

Covid: Record 4.9 million people have the virus in UK,The latest data from the ONS suggests some 4.9 million people in the UK are infected with the virus.,Covid: Record 4.9 million people have the virus in UK Published 1 April comments Comments Share Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES About one in every 13 people in the UK has coronavirus according to latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That is some 4.9 million people up from 4.3 million people the week before. ONS officials say that is the highest number seen since its survey began at the end of April 2020. The surge in infections is being driven partly by the contagious Omicron BA.2 sub-variant and people mixing more. The figures for the week ending 26 March are thought to give the most accurate reflection of whats happening with the virus in the community. The ONS survey tests thousands of people randomly in households across the UK - whether or not they have symptoms. Kara Steel senior statistician for the Covid-19 infection survey said: Infection levels remain high with the highest levels recorded in our survey seen in England and Wales and notable increases among older age groups. The latest data comes on the day that most people in England will have to start paying for Covid-19 tests. The government\s living with Covid plan means free testing will only continue for certain groups - including some people with weakened immune systems people admitted to hospital and health and care staff. In general people who test positive for Covid are now advised to try to stay at home for five days and avoid contact with others. For most children and young people under 18 three days is enough says the latest official advice. Estimated infection rates across the nations showed: One in 13 people in England had coronavirus - about 7.6% of the population up from 6.4% the week before One in 14 people in Wales - or 7% of the population - up from 6.4% the previous week One in 12 people in Scotland - or 8.6%  down from 9% the week before One in 15 people in Northern Ireland - or 6.7% of the population up from 5.9% the week before In England and Wales infections continued to rise while overall trends in Scotland and Northern Ireland were uncertain. The number of people in Covid beds in hospitals has returned to January 2022 levels data from NHS England suggests. But there is a key difference - in January about 56% of people in Covid beds in hospitals were being treated mainly for their Covid but as of Tuesday (29 March) that figure is down to about 44%. And the number of people being treated for very severe Covid infections and needing intensive care remain low - as vaccinations continue to protect people from severe disease. Rates in older people continue to be a concern. On Thursday Prof Sir Johnathan Van-Tam speaking on his last day as Englands deputy chief medical officer said protecting older age groups kept him up at night. At a Royal Society of Medicine conference he said: Case rates here in the UK are really really high and hospitalisations in London for example are becoming exceptionally high again. And what keeps me awake at night is whether the people we have called - over-75s - for their second booster dose are going to come forward really rapidly and really quickly in the next few days and weeks because it is going to be important. People aged over 75 and those who have weakened immune systems can book a spring booster jab to top up their protection against the virus.]
"Ukraine: UK visa process dehumanising, says relative",A woman helping her family to the UK criticises the bureacracy involved in the Ukraine Family Scheme.,Ukraine: UK visa process dehumanising says relative Published 1 April Share IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption Emily Radford is helping the cousin of her Ukrainian wife come to the UK The British wife of a Ukrainian woman has said the visa process for family members fleeing the war is dehumanising. Emily Radford said her partner a British citizen had gone to Poland to bring her cousins family to Sheffield. But she said the three-week visa process had been insane and needlessly bureacratic. The government said it had streamlined the scheme but security checks were vital. Under the Ukraine Family Scheme those fleeing the war are eligible for a UK visa if they are joining a family member based in the country. Ms Radford 39 has been helping the group - which includes four children aged 17. 12 eight and four with the application from home. Gruesome evidence points to war crimes on road to Kyiv How do Russians get news about the war in Ukraine? Could Ukraine win the war? And other questions After a long wait their visas were approved on Wednesday but Ms Radford was critical of the process. She was particularly upset that child applicants had to answer questions about terrorist affiliations and military history. They\ve treated what are primarily women and children as threats first rather than people to help she said. That\s not to say that if it was men it would be different - maybe it would maybe it wouldn\t. But it\s women and kids... I had to answer for a four-year-old: \Are you a terrorist? Have you ever been in the armed forces?\ Why are you asking those questions? It should literally just be: \Are you a child? Who is your mum? OK we\ll sort you out when you\re here and we can have questions with you then if we need to.\ IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption The 39-year-old hoped the family would fly to the UK on Friday Ms Radford said her wife whose name she asked to be withheld found the British visa application difficult. She said that the Polish people have been wonderful but as soon as she interacted with British bureaucracy she felt terrible which is really hard for me to hear as a British person Ms Radford said. She hopes her Ukrainian relatives will be able to fly to the UK on later to join she and her wife in Sheffield. A government spokesperson said: We are moving as quickly as possible to ensure that those fleeing Ukraine can find safety in the UK through the Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine. We continue to speed up visa processing across both schemes with 25500 visas issued in the last three weeks alone and thousands more expected to come through these uncapped routes. While we have streamlined the process simplified our forms and boosted case worker numbers vital security checks are needed to protect our borders and the British people from hostile state actors from Russia who would cynically take advantage of the support we are rightly providing to people fleeing Ukraine.

"'I'm under no illusions,' says British soldier in Ukraine, after comrades killed",Ajay Spence quit his life in Belfast to help defend Kyiv - now he is being redeployed to east Ukraine.,Im under no illusions says British soldier in Ukraine after comrades killed By Emma Vardy BBC News Lviv Ukraine Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption Ajay Spence: I\m under no illusions... you get on with the job in hand I\m not a war tourist or anything like that Ajay tells me from his base near Kyiv where Ukraine\s armed forces have been defending the country\s capital. I was quite comfortable back home sitting with my cat he says in a strong Belfast accent. Ajay Spence travelled to the war in Ukraine from Northern Ireland a month ago having first got in touch with the Ukrainian embassy in Dublin. Having told them about his previous experience with the British army in Afghanistan and Iraq he was soon on his way to Poland before crossing into Ukraine. Seeing the news coverage of the Russian invasion is what spurred Ajay into action. It was just too much to watch you know it\s like asking a firefighter to walk past a burning house and not do anything. WATCH: Ajay and fellow foreign fighter Sandra Ajay was placed in Ukraines foreign legion which is said to have fighters from 50 countries the largest numbers coming from the UK and the US. His unit were deployed on front line operations in towns around the capital Kyiv that saw some of the heaviest fighting including Irpin and Bucha. They helped to drive the Russian forces out of areas that had been captured. Their duties centred around observation missions advancing drawing out fire he says. Witnessed death It\s been pretty heavy work at times. It\s not like Iraq that was a guerrilla warfare situation - this is a conventional war situation against mechanised infantry. But the threat was real. Not long after he arrived on the front lines two fighters in his unit died in front of him. They were killed by indirect fire one bled to death the other was killed instantly. We carried one of them trying to save him while there was heavy shelling around us. It was a traumatic experience. So what about the risk to his own life? I\m under no illusions about that I\m willing to accept that. I\m here to do a job which is to help the Ukrainian people. You just think about stuff like that later and get on with the job in hand. Image caption Ajay and a fellow international legion fighter In the early days of the Russian invasion the position of the UK government on British citizens travelling to fight in Ukraine was unclear but there have since been warnings to people not to travel. Those like Ajay who have been placed into the Ukraines legion of foreign fighters are paid the same as locals - 11-15000 UAH (about £300-400) per month in base pay. There can also be additional pay added on top for those that are deployed to the front during active combat. Communication at least has been manageable for Ajay thanks to the number of English speakers. And the reception from Ukrainians has been warm. When you\re out and about people notice you people come up and shake your hand. I think they need to see things like that because they need to know the world is behind them. Ukraine is a lovely country and to see the destruction and damage and just the pure hatred that\s been thrown against the people here it\s hard to watch. I grew up in Northern Ireland during the Troubles so I\ve got a bit more empathy towards stuff like that. With Russias army having retreated from Kyiv in recent days Ajay says his unit are being redeployed to a new front line. Their mission - to recapture areas currently under Russian occupation. Quit Belfast He surprises me after our interview by sharing a photo of himself dressed in a rather different type of soldiers outfit. Holding a sword instead of the automatic rifle now sitting beside him Ajay explains he had previously worked as an extra in Game of Thrones which was filmed in Northern Ireland. A rather different battlefield from the one he is now on and he says he intends to stay in Ukraine until the war winds down. When I left Belfast I got rid of my apartment so I\ll be here as long as I need to. No one knows how long the conflict will last and there will inevitably be questions about what happens to fighters once they return home to the UK. But for now the international legion says it is proud of its achievements since forming just over a month ago and is advertising on social media for more people to join up.

"Energy rationing not part of UK approach, minister says","Grant Shapps says the policy is ""not a route we want to go down"" despite pressure on supplies.",Energy rationing not part of UK approach minister says Published 3 April Share Media caption Watch Grant Shapps firmly rule out energy rationing for the UK The transport secretary has said energy will not be rationed in the UK despite pressure on supplies globally. Grant Shapps ruled this out after Labours shadow business secretary suggested ministers might need to prepare for rationing. Some European countries have moved towards rationing as energy costs rise and supplies tighten. Mr Shapps told the BBC the energy strategy would be announced later this week. Energy strategy delayed amid Treasury concerns Energy bill shock for millions as rises hit Germany and Austria take step towards gas rationing Plans to expand nuclear and wind power are expected to form part of the strategy which has been delayed amid cost concerns. When pressed on whether he can completely rule out energy rationing he told the BBC\s Sunday Morning programme: Yes I can. It\s not the route that we want to go down. He was responding to Labour\s shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds who told the programme: The government should be preparing not necessarily in public for that situation. But Mr Reynolds later told Times Radio the UK should be not be rationing energy right now. Wind power debate As Mr Shapps ruled out rationing he said wind farms were an immense invisible national resource that could be exploited more and that it was better to build significant wind power offshore. While he said there may be occasions where onshore wind farms made sense he added: I don\t think we want to cover every inch of land in onshore wind farms. In turn offshore wind performs better because it tends to be windier and can be built much much bigger he said. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption The government is looking to increase the amount of energy generated by nuclear power He made the comments after he told Sky News that he did not favour a vast increase in onshore wind farms calling them an eyesore for communities. Sources have told the BBC onshore wind will feature in the governments energy strategy despite some opposition within the cabinet. Cabinet split on wind Onshore wind has long been a topic that has divided the Conservative Party. Former Prime Minister David Cameron said in 2014 people were fed up with seeing them being built and some Conservative activists have criticised their visual impact on the landscape. Planning laws were then tightened in England to make them much harder to build. But recent polls have suggested a majority of the public support onshore wind. Cabinet ministers are split over whether to review those planning rules in England. They have been clear onshore wind and solar farms need local consent and should be accompanied by community benefits. I understand those community benefits are being considered regardless of whether rules are relaxed in England or not. If that happened Scotland and Wales could - in theory - feel the benefit more proportionally. This energy strategy wont be an instant fix to high energy bills. Nuclear power stations for example can take years and be very expensive to build. Meanwhile as the cost of living rises some Tory MPs are calling for the government to pause its net zero plans. But the government argues that moving towards more renewables is the answer to high bills - not the problem. The BBC previously reported that cabinet ministers were split over the idea of relaxing planning laws in England to enable more onshore wind farms - an idea backed by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph Mr Kwarteng said there has to be community consent for onshore wind and fracking a controversial method of mining for shale gas. The BBC has reported one option ministers were considering was lowering energy bills for people near wind turbines. He confirmed that ministers have agreed to set up a new body to oversee delivery of new nuclear plants. The prime minister has previously said he wants 25% of UK energy generated by nuclear by 2050 but the Treasury has raised concerns about some of the costs of these targets. Meanwhile a move away from the use of Russian oil and gas is expected to be addressed in the governments energy strategy which will also outline plans to hit net-zero emissions targets. The UK government has already said it will phase out imports of Russian oil by the end of the year. Russian imports account for 8% of total UK oil demand and 5% of gas supplies and the government is attempting to shore up energy security in the UK following a spike in oil and gas prices since the start of the Ukraine war. A £700-a-year rise in energy costs has put pressure on household budgets in the UK at a time when other hikes to bills are taking effect.]

War set to cut Ukraine's economy by almost half,The World Bank forecasts Ukraine's economy will shrink by 45.1% as a result of Russia's invasion.,War set to cut Ukraines economy by almost half Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Ukraine is a large grain exporter Ukraines economy is set to shrink by almost half this year as a result of the war the World Bank has said. The institution forecasts Russias invasion will cause more economic damage across eastern Europe and parts of Asia than the coronavirus pandemic. The conflict in Ukraine has shut half of the countrys businesses and slashed exports the World Bank said. Anna Bjerde the bank\s vice-president said Ukraine needed massive financial support immediately. The bank has sent almost $1bn of assistance to Ukraine so far and has promised a further $2bn in the coming months. It said the closure of Black Sea shipping from Ukraine had cut off some 90% of the countrys grain exports and half of its total exports. Ukraine is the worlds biggest exporter of sunflower oil and the shutdown of exports has affected global food prices. Ukraine war catastrophic for global food Ukraine war is economic catastrophe - World Bank The World Bank said the war had made economic activity impossible in large parts of the country disrupting farming and harvest operations. The magnitude of the humanitarian crisis unleashed by the war is staggering. The Russian invasion is delivering a massive blow to Ukraine\s economy and it has inflicted enormous damage to infrastructure said Ms Bjerde. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES The bank said the 45.1% contraction estimate excluded the impact of physical infrastructure destruction but said this would hamper future economic output further. While Ukraines economy will suffer the most damage by the war the World Bank said Russias economy had been already plunged into a deep recession as a result of sanctions from Western countries. The sanctions have ranged from cutting ties with Russian banks and targeting Russian politicians and oligarchs to banning luxury goods imports and flights. The bank projected Russias economy would contract by 11.2% in 2022 as the sanctions bite. But while the US has banned all Russian oil and gas imports the EU which gets a quarter of its oil and 40% of its gas from Russia has stopped short of such action. EU countries continue to pay Moscow up to €800m (£674m; $884m) for energy every day which amounts to an estimated 40% of the Kremlins income. The EU has proposed a plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels before 2030. The World Bank said that in addition to Russia and Ukraine Belarus the Kyrgyz Republic Moldova and Tajikistan were projected to fall into recession this year. It said growth projections had been downgraded in all economies because of the war with weaker-than-expected growth in the euro area. The Ukraine war and the pandemic have once again shown that crises can cause widespread economic damage and set back years of per capita income and development gains said Asli Demirgüç-Kunt World Bank chief economist for Europe and Central Asia.]
Sunflower oil: UK bottler has a few weeks' supply left,"Makers of oven chips, crisps, ready meals and cereal bars are racing to find alternatives.",Sunflower oil: UK bottler has a few weeks supply left By Emma Simpson Business correspondent BBC News Published 3 April Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EDIBLE OILS Image caption Edible Oils Ltd bottles cooking oils for 75% of the UKs retail market The biggest cooking oil bottler for UK shops has said it only has a few weeks supply of sunflower oil left. Ukraine and Russia produce most of the worlds sunflower oil and the war is disrupting exports said Edible Oils. The company which packages oil for 75% of the UK retail market is ramping up supplies of other oils for shoppers. Meanwhile manufacturers of foods that contain sunflower oil like crisps oven chips and cereal bars are reworking their recipes. The Food Standards Agency has advised people with allergies to look out for extra information from shops and food makers. Kim Matthews commercial director at Edible Oils said 80% of the global supply of sunflower oil comes out of Russia and Ukraine. So obviously with everything going on out there we physically can\t get sunflower to be coming out of the country he said. Image caption Kim Matthews is commercial director of Edible Oils which usually fills 32 million bottles of sunflower oil a year If you buy any cooking oil on the supermarket shelves chances are it has come from the Edible Oils plant in Erith on the outskirts of south-east London. It bottles oil for brands and retailers own label products. From a UK consumer perspective sunflower oil is the biggest oil. It\s used more than anything else said Mr Matthews. It\s a fast moving situation. We\re still trying to see if we can get some more but it\s looking very tight. Edible Oils Ltd has upped production to 24/7 to try to make sure it has plenty of rapeseed and other oils to put on the shelves when the sunflower oil goes. Sunflower is great because you can cook at high temperatures. Rapeseed is very similar. You can do exactly the same with it he said. But it was far from clear when sunflower oil supplies will be back to normal he said. At the moment Ukrainian farmers should be sowing the seeds now for the harvest in October and November. Clearly that\s not going to happen… we\re probably going to miss the season so we could be impacted for 12-18 months. Image caption The recipes for hundreds of food products are being reformulated due to the lack of sunflower oil Sunflower oil can also be found in many hundreds of products like ready meals biscuits and mayonnaise. Food manufacturers are now racing to find alternative ingredients. The British Snack Company makes a small but popular range of hand cooked crisps for sale in pubs. After potatoes its other key ingredient is sunflower oil. The supply of sunflower oil is something that we\ve always taken for granted said founder Tom Lock. Shortly after the invasion he had to quickly come up with a plan B and has already switched to rapeseed oil which is very similar. There\s an incredible scramble. Everyone\s doing the same thing. So while sunflower oil is impossible to get at the moment rapeseed oil is possible but difficult to get as well obviously because everyone\s having the same idea as prices are skyrocketing at the moment. Image caption Tom Lock has switched to rapeseed oil to cook his crisps Rapeseed is used far more in the food supply chain according to the National Edible Oil Distributors Association. British farmers grow rapeseed but there wont be enough to go round. Prices for rapeseed oil have risen 50-70% since the attack said NEODA\s President Gary Lewis. But there\s a limited supply to cover all this demand so some shortfall will be expected. Mr Locks crisp business had to pay through the nose because otherwise he would have run out of crisps which makes up more than two-thirds of his sales. He says hell absorb the costs as much as he can but if the situation carries on hell have to increase prices. One immediate headache he and other food manufacturers dont have to worry about is labelling. Theyre being allowed to switch ingredients without having to print new packaging which can take up to 12 weeks. Emily Miles chief executive at the Food Standards Agency said allergic reactions to rapeseed oil were very rare and if they do occur are mild and advised anyone with allergies to look out for extra information. Image caption Ged Futter said the UKs food supply issues were a once in a lifetime situation For grocery expert Ged Futter the food industry is now grappling with supply issues not experienced since the end of World War Two. Retailers and suppliers have to work much more closely than they ever have before and to be much more flexible in their approach to make sure the products are on the shelf he said. The immediate focus is sunflower oil and rapeseed oil but there will be many more products which will be affected over the coming months. It\s some of the ingredients you don\t even think about like starch which comes from wheat. He believes thousands of products will have to be reformulated. Mr Futter runs a business advising suppliers on how to deal with retailers. He says the ripple effects from the war are creating scarily high price rises adding to already rising prices on the supermarket shelves. I think the level of food inflation we are now going to be seeing will be in excess of 15%. Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Global supply chain management Retailing Supermarkets Food]
Ukraine village scarred by aftermath of occupation,"As Russian forces retreat to eastern Ukraine, Andriivka and other abandoned villages are left devastated.",Ukraine village scarred by aftermath of occupation By Mark Lowen BBC News Andriivka Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption Many buildings in Andriivka are a mess of rubble The day after Anton Ischenko celebrated his 23rd birthday he was taken by the Russians led away at gunpoint from his home in the village of Andriivka west of Kyiv. His family found his body a month later once the Russian troops were driven out. He was so badly mutilated that they had to identify him by his clothes. As Russian forces retreat to eastern Ukraine horrors are being uncovered in the villages which they left. About 1000 people lived in Andriivka some 60km away from the capital. At least 40 of them were killed. He was a very nice boy very clever - he recited poetry recalls Anton\s grandmother Tetiana sitting outside the family house. Suddenly her exhausted face crumples. Image caption Tetiana is grieving for her grandson Maybe if he had gone to fight somewhere else he would have returned here in one piece she says struggling to speak through her tears. When my husband told the Russians \Take me instead\ they pointed a machine gun at him and said \Go home - or we will take you both.\ Andriivka on the route up to the Belarus border has been blighted by battle and the month-long occupation. Buildings are ripped apart amid a mess of rubble and mangled metal. Craters lie in the dirt road where tanks were blown up. Remnants of artillery lie beside corpses of chickens and rabbits. Burnt-out armoured vehicles lie at either end of the village. It is a scene of utter devastation. Image caption Grigoriy Klymenko stayed throughout the occupation With the Russians pushed out some residents are beginning to return - or emerge from shelters. On the main road beside wooden boxes that contained grad missiles Grigoriy Klymenko is taking in the sight of destruction. He decided to stay throughout the occupation to be with his 90-year-old mother who is bedridden. They had watched in terror as tanks encircled the village. They\re animals he says of the forces that moved in. Humans don\t behave like this. My parents told me about the war and the fascists didn\t even do such things. Next door Leonid Koval and his son are beginning to repair their damaged house retiling the roof and fixing plastic sheeting into blown-out windows. Russian soldiers stayed in his home - and looted it. Image caption Leonid Koval and his son have begun repair work Inside the cupboards lie wrenched apart by the Russian occupiers boxes of photographs and clothes turned upside down. Cushions were ripped from the sofa. The soldiers emptied everything they could find. When the Ukrainian army began to push towards Andriivka the Russians staying there moved out of the main house and into the tiny cellar to hide. Leonid takes me down to the cold and dark space the mattresses and blankets they used still stuffed against the wall. To one side are the open packets of biscuits and jars of pickled fruit they feasted on. As he surveys the damage to his home Leonid breaks down. I don\t know what they were looking for he says they just destroyed everything. I have no words to describe what they did. Image caption Andriivka is a scene of devastation The scarred villages and towns near Kyiv and Chernihiv in northern Ukraine from where the Russians have retreated are now sites of possible war crimes. Andriivka joins a growing list - with Bucha Irpin and others - which bear the hallmarks of deliberate targeting of civilians and other atrocities banned by the rules of war. And they are grim omens of what may be in store in the east where Russian forces are now intensifying their attacks ahead of a new offensive. What nightmares will be found there once the shroud of war finally lifts? On the edge of Andriivka cemetery the remains of Tetianas grandson Anton lie in a fresh grave. His family have only now been able to bury him. The 23-year-old was studying to become an electrician. We wanted to bury him separately and with a priest not just in a mass grave she says. I had two daughters so he was our boy. We only had one boy. War in Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine BROKEN PROMISE: Will UN be true to its word? WHAT NEXT?

Trip to take ambulances from Warwickshire to Ukraine 'intense',"The two men made the journey under the Ambulance Aid project, using ex-NHS ambulances",Trip to take ambulances from Warwickshire to Ukraine intense Published 1 day ago Share Image caption Mark Pritchard-Jeffs said he had done nothing like this sort of venture before A man who paid £9000 for an old ambulance says a mission to take it across six countries to help people in Ukraine was pretty intense. Mark Pritchard-Jeffs and friend Alf Rajkowski - who also bought an ambulance - drove them from Hampton Lucy in Warwickshire to Poland. Medical supplies were also delivered when they handed over the vehicles 30 miles (48.28km) from the border. Mr Pritchard-Jeffs said he heard the vehicles got to where they were needed. His group had planned to transfer them to an ambulance service in Poland which would make arrangements to cross the border with Ukraine. The two men made the journey under the Ambulance Aid project which used ex-NHS ambulances and they were joined by two co-drivers so they could take rests. It began on Wednesday morning and Mr Pritchard-Jeffs said 31 hours travelling non-stop... was a pretty intense experience one I\ll never forget. One major threat to the mission\s success came when they misfuelled one ambulance he said. He stated: We put petrol in rather than diesel and actually there\s a.... German garage attendant who drew our attention to it. We realised afterwards that if he hadn\t raised the alarm we\d have written one of the ambulances off and that ambulance and the medical supplies would never have got there. IMAGE SOURCE AMBULANCE AID Image caption The vehicles were handed over 30 miles from the border with Ukraine Mr Rajkowski said he had spent £8000 on a decommissioned ambulance and his friend paid £9000. Medical Aid Ukraine in the West Midlands stocked them. Mr Pritchard-Jeffs stated the group was absolutely exhausted when they arrived and he did not know at the time if people receiving ambulances would successfully get to where they wanted to. But he added that subsequently he found that was the case.

The paper reports that Mr Zelensky praised the British PM as one of the most principled opponents of the Russian invasion. Image caption Scotland needs 79000 new construction workers by the end of the decade if it is to meet its climate change targets reports the Herald. An inquiry by the Fair Work Convention (FWC) has warned about 50000 tradespeople are due to retire in the next 10 years with fears that not enough young people are entering the sector. Image caption Meanwhile the Mail on Sunday says that Mr Sunak is battling to save his political career after he continued to face questions over his family\s financial affairs on Saturday. The paper reports that the chancellor is also facing claims that he broke US immigration rules and that friends of Mr Sunak say he considered resigning from the Cabinet last week to spare further scrutiny. His wife Akshata Murty has said she will pay UK taxes on her overseas income following a row over her non-domicile status. Image caption The Sunday Times also reports that Mr Sunak was on the verge of resigning last week citing close allies to the chancellor. Its lead story is on Mr Sunak moving his family out of Downing Street. Ms Murty and her daughters will reportedly now reside full-time at their family home in west London the paper adds. Mr Sunak will split his time between there and the Downing Street flat the paper says noting there is no modern precedent for a chancellor or prime minister moving out of Downing Street while still in post.

Boy carpenter's Ukraine bowl raffle smashes target,Gabriel Clark from Cumbria is donating money made from the raffle to families affected by the war.,Boy carpenters Ukraine bowl raffle smashes target Published 2 days ago Share IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption Gabriel Clarke said the bowl was quite simple to make but took a long time A 12-year-old boy who carved a bowl to raffle for Ukrainian refugees said he was very happy after his fundraising target was exceeded by 1500%. Gabriel Clark from Cumbria started his Bowl For Ukraine appeal after worrying about the plight of children in the country. Thousands of people entered the raffle and he has now raised more than £76300 - initially he hoped for £6000. The winner will be picked at random and announced on Easter Sunday on 17 April. Gabriel went viral online last month when his father Richard Clark issued a plea for people to follow his sons Instagram account showing pictures of his handcrafted creations - including wooden chopping boards bowls and even drumsticks. Gabriel said he got into woodwork at the age of about three or four. My mother gave me her grandfather\s hammer and some nails and I had some very soft wood called balsa wood so I\d hammer nails into it and make sculptures he said. I\d really enjoy it and do it non-stop for hours. Terrifying tools His father said: His workplace was the hearth originally and then slowly we began to create other places to help him make the most out of it but every time we gave him a new space he grew out of it in about six months. Then about two years ago we built him a workshop and he got various tools for it for Christmases and birthdays - some very terrifying tools which he uses really comfortably. Image caption The bowl is etched with a blue and yellow ring - the colours of the Ukrainian flag The bowl was easy to make Gabriel said. You do it on the lathe and chisel out the inside and round out the outside he said. So it\s quite simple but it does take a long time.

"Homes for Ukraine: Visa silence unwelcoming, Cardiff peer says",Baroness Finlay of Llandaff has been trying for three weeks to open her home to a family of refugees.,Homes for Ukraine: Visa silence unwelcoming Cardiff peer says Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption Hundreds of refugees have been living in an athletics centre in Moldova The UK\s Ukrainian visa scheme is unwelcoming a crossbench peer offering her home to a fleeing family has said. Baroness Ilora Finlay of Llandaff has been waiting three weeks for visas for a mother and two children to be cleared through the Homes for Ukraine scheme. She and her husband have already prepared their Cardiff home for them. The UK government said it was working as quickly as possible but accept progress has not been quick enough. Baroness Finlay told the PA news agency she did not wish to identify the refugee family but said they were known to her and her husband Prof Andrew Finlay before the Russian invasion. She said visa issues are causing uncertainty and adding to refugees trauma. Ukrainian refugee family thwarted by paperwork Ten thousand in Wales offer homes to refugees War in Ukraine: Whats the latest situation? She said the father of the family is a doctor in Ukraine who had worked with her husband and remained in Kyiv. They have also submitted an application for him in the event he also leaves Ukraine due to injury or other reasons. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption More than 10000 people in Wales have expressed interest in housing Ukrainian refugees Prof Finlay spent eight hours filling out forms for their visa applications on 18 March the day the scheme launched. We\ve said we will do whatever is needed for however long to support them and we know that it might be years said Baroness Finlay. She explained that each of the four visa applications have been processed individually which has made her concerned they may not be approved together. Despite repeated efforts in person at a visa information centre and over the phone she said the only information she has received has been four separate emails to say each applicant is in the system to be processed - which arrived on Thursday. Image caption Baroness Finlay: This uncertainty is adding to the trauma that these people have already experienced The silence is awful... nobody can help me find out what\s happened to these people\s applications she said. I think there is a failure of recognition that this uncertainty is adding to the trauma that these people have already experienced. The message from the system is that the country is not welcoming them. The couple have bought an extra bed and fridge among other things for the family clearing space in their kitchen cupboards so they can have space to cook their own meals. A government spokesperson said: The Home Office has made changes to visa processing - the application form has been streamlined Ukrainian passport holders can now apply online and do their biometrics checks once in the UK and greater resource has gone into the system.]

What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up?,UK inflation is rising at its fastest rate for 30 years and some predict it could go even higher.,What is the UKs inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? Published 31 March Share IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES UK inflation is rising at its fastest rate for 30 years as fuel energy and food costs surge. The price rises are putting increasing pressure on household budgets. Which prices are going up? From 1 April fuel bills for about 18 million households on standard tariffs will go up by an average of £693 when the energy cap goes up. Some 4.5 million prepayment customers will see an average increase of £708. Fuel prices may go up again in October when the energy cap is next reviewed. The rate of VAT - the tax paid when buying goods and services - is also going up for some businesses. The government reduced the rate paid by hospitality and tourism firms to 12.5% in July 2020 to help them recover from the pandemic. However from 1 April VAT returns to the standard rate of 20%. Some companies have said they will pass this increase on to customers. On 6 April companies workers and the self-employed will start paying 1.25p more in the pound in National Insurance contributions under the Health and Social Care Levy. Air passenger duty and vehicle excise duty rates are also increasing this month as is the cost of stamps and water bills in England and Wales. Food prices have also gone up sharply. Petrol prices have risen to record levels. Higher interest rates are making mortgage payments more expensive for some homeowners. Regulated rail fares in England have already gone up by up to 3.8% in England and Wales the highest fare rises for nine years. Why are prices rising now? The main reason is the rising global price of energy which is affecting companies across the whole economy. Wholesale gas prices in particular have risen sharply over the past year forcing energy prices up and putting a number of suppliers out of business. The Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) which publishes economic forecasts twice a year has warned that Russia\s invasion of Ukraine could have major repercussions for the global economy and push energy petrol and food costs even higher. Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES What is the UKs inflation rate and how high could it go? Inflation is measured by a body called the Office for National Statistics (ONS) which notes the prices of hundreds of everyday items known as the basket of goods. The basket is constantly updated. In 2022 items such as tinned beans and sports bras were added reflecting a rising interest in plant-based diets and exercise. The ONS releases its measure of inflation each month showing how much these prices have risen since the same date last year. This is known as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). You may not notice price rises from month to month. But right now prices across a number of areas are all rising very quickly. In the 12 months to February prices rose 6.2% on average. That means they are now going up at their fastest rate for 30 years. But the OBR has suggested that the fallout from the war in Ukraine could push inflation to a 40-year high of 8.7% in the final three months of 2022. The Bank of England has also warned that inflation could hit double digits if rising fuel prices mean the energy price cap goes up again when it next changes in October. Whats happening to wages? Average pay increases arent keeping pace with inflation. Figures from the ONS show that wages rose by 3.8% between November and January. But when you take inflation into account regular pay actually fell by 1% compared to 12 months ago. IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption About two million workers will benefit from increases in the minimum wage Some parts of the economy facing staff shortages as a result of Brexit and the pandemic have increased staff pay. Workers in a few sectors who are in high demand - such as lorry drivers - are seeing their wages rise faster than inflation. And on 1 April the lowest-paid will see the National Living Wage rise by 6.6% to £9.50 an hour which is higher than the current inflation rate. Fury after Bank boss says dont ask for big pay rise Seven reasons living costs are rising around the world What can be done to tackle inflation? The Bank of Englands traditional response to rising inflation is to raise interest rates. It has done this three times in the past few months. This can benefit savers but means some people with mortgages see their monthly payments go up. The idea is that when borrowing is more expensive people will have less money to spend. As a result they will buy fewer things and prices will stop rising as fast. But when inflation is caused by external forces such as the global squeeze on energy prices then this might not be the answer. The government might choose instead to cut taxes for consumers on items that are rising quickly. Chancellor Rishi Sunak cut fuel duty by 5p per litre in his Spring Statement for example although the RAC motoring group said the cut was not being fully passed on to consumers at the pump.

Jacob and Oliver go to singing lessons together in Wolverhampton and were inspired to adapt the song. They aimed to raise £500 for the DEC Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal which they have achieved. The boys have been offered the chance to perform their song at The Beatles Story museum in Liverpool. The eight-year-olds adapted the lyrics to one of the quartets best known songs to reflect the war in Ukraine and posted a video on YouTube attracting hundreds of views. Beatles fan Jacob who also played the piano in their recording said the song has quite a good tune and we thought we could change the lyrics to it to make something new. Their adapted lyrics include the line: Families parted broken hearted children crying in the street... there must be an answer let them be. We wanted to help children that have been affected by the war said Jacob. News of their fundraising efforts reached The Beatles Story museum in Liverpool who responded by offering the boys tickets and a chance to perform their song at the museum. Jacobs mum Emma said she was very proud. They\ve worked really hard they\re both really busy but they found time to practise and make sure it\s as good as it can be she said. They\ve got quite an ambitious goal £500 is a big target for two 8-year-old boys. It\s something they can be really proud of when they\re older.

He said: I made clear today that the United Kingdom stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight and we are in it for the long run. We are stepping up our own military and economic support and convening a global alliance to bring this tragedy to an end and ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation. Mr Johnson also confirmed further economic support taking total UK loan guarantees to £770m. Speaking in a video address alongside President Zelensky a short while later Mr Johnson said Ukrainians have shown the courage of a lion but you Volodymyr have given the roar of that lion. He reiterated that the UK and other countries supporting Ukraine would continue to tighten economic sanctions on Moscow including moving away from the use of Russian hydrocarbons. The PM added: Over the last few hours I\ve been able to see quite a lot of your beautiful country and it\s an amazing country. I\ve also seen the tragic effects of the war an inexcusable war an absolutely inexcusable and unnecessary war.

The UK video games market is worth a record £7.16bn,Gamers in the UK spent more last year than they did during the height of lockdown.,The UK video games market is worth a record £7.16bn By Steffan Powell Gaming reporter Published 31 March comments Comments Share IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES The value of the UK video games market continued to grow in 2021 reaching a record high of £7.16bn - an increase of 2% on 2020. UK gamers spent more last year than they did during the height of lockdown according to trade body UKIE. Sales of consoles including the much coveted Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X/S brought in £1.13bn. UK games revenue has grown steadily in recent years. The latest figure marks an increase of 32% compared with 2019. Given that many turned to gaming during the pandemic to provide entertainment whilst stuck indoors it would not have been a surprise had the market shrunk after restrictions were loosened. Image caption Sales of the PS5 and Xbox Series X have driven a record high level of consumer spending in the gaming market And while last years 2% rise might be modest compared with the nearly 30% leap from 2019s £5.35bn to 2020s £7bn its a rise nonetheless. The latest annual valuation of gaming revenue in the UK gives an indication of not only how much is being spent but also where that money is being spent. Despite consistent concerns over availability since their release in late 2020 Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X/S console sales have helped propel the games market in the UK to record heights. Supply chain issues caused by the pandemic have frustrated some who have found it difficult to get hold of new consoles with a global chip shortage restricting the number of machines hitting the shops. IMAGE SOURCE BBC+- Despite this console hardware sales still made up £1.13bn of the overall value of the market - an increase of more than 30% on the previous year thanks to those releases and a new Nintendo Switch hitting the market. With supply issues easing and more signature games becoming available for the latest generation of consoles we can expect this trend to continue ahead of next years figures. Games makers might be concerned that despite this overall increase in revenue the amount of money people are spending on games themselves has gone down. Income from the purchase of releases has reduced by 6% compared with 2020. One of the criticisms of the new consoles is a lack of games tailored to the latest technology. Developers will hope that this is the reason behind the slowdown in software sales rather than a more fundamental change in consumer behaviour. IMAGE SOURCE WARNER BROS/WIZARDING WORLD Image caption 2022 looks to have a stronger line-up of game releases compared to last year With major titles like Horizon Forbidden West Elden Ring Starfield and Harry Potter: Hogwarts Legacy coming in 2022 the industry will be banking on a significant increase in game sales figures next year. The only category of software sales not to decline was mobile games. They maintained their 2020 level once again worth £1.46bn. After being hailed as the next generation of gaming for some time - but failing to yet breakthrough to compete with more traditional forms of the medium - fans of virtual reality will be pleased to see that VR hardware sales rose significantly increasing by 41.9% to reach £183m in 2021. In the year that Facebook rebranded as Meta and placed a big emphasis on VR technology and its application in the Metaverse an increase in headset sales might have been expected. Video game licensed toys and merchandise also saw a significant boost last year mainly because of the success of Pokémon merchandise. Like video games?

Ukraine: Three ways this war could escalate and drag Nato in,How exactly could this conflict escalate into a wider pan-European conflict that drags in Nato?,Ukraine: Three ways this war could escalate and drag Nato in By Frank Gardner Security correspondent Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Woman surveys wreckage of Bucha near Kyiv Nato ministers have been meeting in Brussels this past week to discuss how far they should go in providing military equipment to Ukraine. The challenge for Nato throughout this war has been how to give its ally Ukraine enough military support to defend itself without getting drawn into the conflict and finding itself at war with Russia. The Ukrainian government has been explicit in its calls for help. If it is to have any chance of fending off the coming Russian assault on the Donbas region in the east of the country it says then it urgently needs a resupply of the Wests Javelin NLAW (next-generation light anti-tank weapon) Stinger and Starstreak anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles that its forces have already been using to such effect in this war. That much is coming. But Ukraine wants more. It wants tanks warplanes drones and advanced missile air defence systems to counter Russias increasing use of air strikes and long-range missiles that are steadily depleting Ukraines strategic stores of fuel and other essentials. What weapons will US give Ukraine? Has Putins plan failed? Watch on BBC iPlayer So what exactly many people may ask is holding Nato back? The answer is escalation. The risk of Russia resorting to using tactical (ie short range) nuclear weapons or of the conflict spreading beyond Ukraines borders into a wider European war is constantly in the backs of western leaders minds and here the stakes are dangerously high. What West has given so far over 30 countries have provided military aid to Ukraine including €1bn (£800m) from EU and $1.7bn (£1.3bn) from US supplies so far limited to arms ammunition and defensive equipment like anti-tank and anti-aircraft missile systems they include Javelins which are shoulder-held anti-tank weapons that shoot heat-seeking rockets and Stingers which are man-portable anti-aircraft weapons most famously used in Afghanistan against Soviet aircraft the Starstreak is a UK-made portable air defence system Nato members fear supplying heavier offensive equipment like tanks and fighter jets could lead to direct open conflict with Russia That hasnt prevented the Czechs from giving T72 tanks President Putin reminded the world early on in this war that Russia is a nuclear weapons power and that he was moving its strategic nuclear deterrent up to a higher degree of readiness. The US did not follow suit as it detected no movement of Russian nuclear warheads out of their secure storage bunkers. But Putin\s point was made. He was effectively saying: Russia has a massive nuclear arsenal so don\t think you can push us around. Russian military doctrine allows for the early use of low-yield tactical nuclear warheads on the battlefield knowing that the West has an abhorrence for nuclear weapons that have not been used in anger for 77 years. Nato strategic planners worry that once the nuclear taboo is broken even if the damage is limited to a localised target on the Ukrainian battlefield then the risk of escalation to a catastrophic nuclear exchange between Russia and the West inevitably goes up a notch. Getty Images What the US is sending Ukraine $800m in new military assistance including... 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems that can shoot down planes 2000 Javelins shoulder-held anti-tank weapons that shoot heat-seeking rockets 6000 AT-4 anti-armor systems a Swedish-produced single-use unguided anti-tank weapon Source: BBC And yet with every atrocity apparently committed by Russian soldiers Natos resolve stiffens and its inhibitions melt away. The Czech Republic has already sent tanks admittedly outdated Soviet-era T72s but they are the first Nato country to do so. Slovakia is sending its S300 air defence missile systems. Both such moves would have seemed improbably risky when this war began. Tobias Ellwood MP who chairs Parliaments Defence Committee is one of those who believes Putin is bluffing when he raises the spectre of nuclear weapons and that Nato should be doing more. \We have been over-cautious in the weapons systems we have been willing to provide he says. We need a more robust attitude. We\re giving the Ukrainians enough to survive but not to win and that must change. So how exactly could this Russia-Ukraine war escalate into a wider pan-European conflict that drags in Nato? There are a number of potential scenarios which will doubtless be occupying minds in Western defence ministries. Here are just three of them: 1. A Nato-supplied anti-ship missile fired by Ukrainian forces in Odesa hits and sinks a Russian warship offshore in the Black Sea with the loss of nearly 100 sailors and dozens of marines. A death toll of this magnitude in a single strike would be unprecedented and Putin would be under pressure to respond in some form. 2. A Russian strategic missile strike targets a supply convoy of military hardware crossing from a Nato country like Poland or Slovakia into Ukraine. If casualties were sustained on Natos side of the border that could potentially trigger Article 5 of Natos constitution bringing the entire alliance to the defence of the country attacked. 3. Amidst fierce fighting in the Donbas an explosion occurs at an industrial facility resulting in the release of toxic chemical gases. While this has already occurred there were no deaths reported. But were it to result in the sort of mass casualties seen in Syrias use of poison gas at Ghouta and if it were found to have been deliberately caused by Russian forces then Nato would be obliged to respond. It is perfectly possible that none of these scenarios will materialise. But while Western nations have displayed a rare degree of unity in the strength of their reaction to Russias invasion there are suggestions that they are being merely reactive and not thinking through what the endgame should be. Media caption This video shared by Ukrainian armed forces shows a Russian helicopter being shot down by a missile The bigger strategic question says one of Britain\s most experienced military officers who asks not to be named is whether our government is engaged in crisis management or actual strategy. That would require thinking this through to the finish he adds. What we are trying to achieve here is to give Ukraine every bit of help we can short of World War Three. The problem is Putin is a better poker player than we are. Tobias Ellwood MP agrees. Russia does this the threat of escalation] very effectively. And we are spooked. We have lost the ability to control the escalatory ladder.

How will Russia attack in east Ukraine?,"Artillery may decide the key battles looming in Donetsk and Luhansk, say military analysts.",How will Russia attack in east Ukraine? By David Brown BBC News Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war The conflict in Ukraine has shifted to the east of the country where Ukrainian forces are battle-hardened and well-prepared. Analysts believe Ukraines best units are in the east and that they are dug into trench systems and other fortified positions. So far Ukrainian troops have strongly resisted the Russian advance but they could be heavily outnumbered by Russian forces who are inching forwards in some areas. Where will the key battles be fought? Russian officials have said that the focus of its forces is now the complete liberation of the Donbas broadly referring to Ukraine\s eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. The terrain in the east will pose big challenges for the Russians as they attack. With less wooded land than the north of the country analysts say open areas may favour the Ukrainian defenders. The battle for Slovyansk is likely to be the next pivotal battle of the war according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). If Russian troops advancing from Izyum are able to take the town they could then choose to advance east towards Severodonetsk to encircle a relatively small group of Ukrainian forces or head further south to encircle a larger Ukrainian contingent. If Mariupol falls to the Russians more troops may also be available to push north into the area west of Donetsk. How are the Ukrainians preparing? Brigadier Ben Barry (retired) of the International Institute for Strategic Studies says Ukrainian forces have had years to prepare their defences and that Russian troops may struggle to force them out. It\s not just World War One-style trenches on the Ukrainian side they will have also fortified key towns and villages they want to defend he says. Ukrainian armoured vehicles and other equipment are positioned in revetments or earth banks for protection he says. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Ukrainian soldier shoots at a drone from a trench near Kharkiv Many Ukrainian troops in the east are highly experienced - they have been holding back Russian separatists since the conflict of 2014. Their numbers may also be boosted should Ukraines military chiefs re-deploy units no longer needed to defend Kyiv after Russias withdrawal from the north. How will Russia attack? Brigadier Barry says Russia is likely to make heavy use of artillery to break down strong Ukrainian defences from the air before pushing forward on the ground. Artillery is heavy weaponry designed to fire munitions much further than small arms Attacking Ukrainian troops head on with infantry without a heavy artillery bombardment first risks huge Russian casualties and greatly increases the risk of defeat. Russia has a range of weaponry to draw on. In particular self-propelled artillery in which Russia dominates will be a very significant factor says Brigadier Barry. Self-propelled artillery has the appearance of a tank but fires munitions upwards to then fall on to a target rather than shooting directly at it. It is more heavily protected than a towed gun and can advance quickly when enemy defences break down. Those opportunities to move forward may be rare however as front lines become semi-fixed in many areas. It could take on quite a bloody and attritional feel says Brigadier Barry. To pound Ukrainian positions from a greater distance Russia has grad multiple rocket launcher systems and is likely to use them heavily. Grads have 40 rockets which can be fired in as little as 20 seconds and have already inflicted a catastrophic toll on civilian populations in some areas reducing residential districts of Kharkiv Mariupol and other cities to rubble. Reports suggest thermobaric weapons have also been used by Russian forces in parts of Ukraine including Mariupol in Donetsk and Izyum in Kharkiv. They are much more devastating than conventional explosives of similar size scattering a fuel mixture as a cloud which then detonates producing a huge fireball and massive blast wave. Samuel Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute says they are primarily designed for urban warfare because the cloud of fuel mixture which is scattered after the initial impact can penetrate gaps in buildings before detonating. If Russian artillery is successful in destroying key Ukrainian defences Russia is likely to use infantry with small arms and a range of wheeled and tracked vehicles together with tanks with heavy fire power to lead advances across terrain swept by Ukrainian fire. Air power in support could include fighter bombers and attack helicopters. Ukraine\s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba says the fighting will remind you of the Second World War.

Analysts say it is unclear whether Russian forces have addressed the serious logistical problems they encountered in the first weeks of this campaign. Troops struggled with insufficient fuel food water and basic equipment such as radios and cold weather clothing. The key will also be training motivation and leadership. The Russians did not perform well around Kyiv and we just don\t know whether they have learned the lessons says Brigadier Barry. Reports also suggest that Russia has lost more than three times as much military hardware as Ukraine in the war so far. How this might affect the war in the east is unclear but replacing lost equipment could present serious challenges. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption A Russian tank destroyed near Kharkiv Oryx an open source military analysis website tracks military equipment losses and only includes destroyed vehicles and equipment of which photographic or video evidence is available. It estimates that Russia has lost more than 400 tanks 20 aircraft and 32 helicopters as well as hundreds of armoured vehicles and other equipment. Smaller Ukrainian losses may reflect the size of Ukraines armed forces but may also signal tactical success. Ukraine has captured significant amounts of Russian equipment but it is unclear how useful it will be. Michael Kofman of the US-based Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) says: It\s going to be a while before this kit is serviceable manned and deployed where it makes a tangible difference. A few captured tanks or IFVs Infantry Fighting Vehicles] do not an armoured brigade make. In the long run Russia may also have a crucial advantage particularly if Western supplies to Ukraine continue to be restricted to defensive equipment. Mr Cranny-Evans says: For every Ukrainian grad rocket launcher or howitzer destroyed in most cases there are no replacements they\re gone. But Russia still has manufacturing capability - so for Russian troops these things are not irreplaceable. So as the war goes on time begins to shift in Russia\s favour.

Ukraine war: Disbelief and horror after Kramatorsk train station attack,The people of Kramatorsk are coming to terms with a strike on a train station that killed more than 50.,Ukraine war: Disbelief and horror after Kramatorsk train station attack By Jonathan Beale BBC News Kramatorsk Published 2 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS More than 50 people were killed and many more wounded in a missile strike on a train station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk on Friday. One day later people are attempting to pick up the pieces from the deadly attack. Theyre still searching through the wreckage and debris at Kramatorsk station. The bodies of the dead were soon removed from the scene of a missile strike on Friday but you can still see the dried blood and some evidence of human remains 24 hours later. The uncollected travel bags of those who did not survive have been gathered together and now lie in an empty ticket office. Sergei a volunteer with the Ukrainian Army was still looking through the wreckage of destroyed cars parked outside the station. There was evidence in one of a burnt childs body. Sergei is used to death. Hes been recovering the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers killed in battle. But on Friday he was having to gather the corpses and the remains of unarmed civilians - the innocents of this war. He has no doubt that Russia is to blame for the attack that has left more than 50 people dead and many more injured. Watching mothers grieve over children killed in the blast has clearly taken its toll on Sergei. When you see our future the future of Ukraine being killed you can\t control your emotions he says. He calls it a genocide. You just don\t understand the motivation of the people who did this. What was this for? Thousands of people were gathered at Kramatorsk station when the missile struck at 10:30 in the morning. They were waiting for a train to take them west to relative safety. The regions authorities had told civilians to leave as Russia steps up its offensive in the Donbas. Kramatorsk and a number of other cities in eastern Ukraine have recently been targeted by Russian airstrikes artillery and missiles. Media caption WATCH: Burnt-out cars and remains of a missile outside Kramatorsk station Russia has denied it was responsible for Fridays attack. It even claims that it wasnt their missile. Its still not clear what exactly happened. Ukraines state railway says the station was hit by two missiles. The damage is certainly spread over a wide area. Its possible there were three missiles - and one was shot down by Ukraines air defences. On Saturday investigators were examining the remains of what looks like a Tochka missile which landed just yards from the station. Part of the casing remains intact. In white paint someone has written in Russian: For the Children. Was it meant as some kind of revenge? If so for what? What we know so far about the attack Eyewitnesses also describe seeing multiple explosions raising questions as to whether the missile or missiles had been fitted with cluster munitions. Banned by many countries theyre designed to kill and maim over a wide area. At Kramatorsk hospital medical staff had been working through the day and night to treat the many injured. Surgeon Victor Borisovich said six people died before they had a chance to operate. Another two died after surgery - including a young child. Victor says many were life-threatening injuries which he lists as amputations torn limbs torn feet stomach wounds and brain injuries. He tells me he has no doubt that the injuries and deaths were the responsibility of Russia. I can\t imagine what kind of person takes the decision to launch a missile into a place where civilians are gathering he says. It just cannot be explained. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES When we arrived at the hospital a small number of patients were being loaded into ambulances to be taken to Dnipro further west for surgery. They still had pieces of shrapnel embedded in their bodies. Some were clearly still in shock. One woman said it was a miracle shed survived. She described the scene. There were a lot of explosions. I fell down then I started running but people started to shout \Get down\ so I fell on the ground again. When she got up again she says she realised many were dead. God saved me she says. Few of those we spoke to were willing to say who was responsible for their injuries. One woman did blame Russia but she also suggested that the target might have been a train carrying military equipment. We saw no evidence of that when we arrived a few hours after the blast. It is still possible that the people waiting for a train were not the intended target. Western officials say that a Tochka missile also known as an SS-21 Scarab can miss its target by up to 30m. Even that suggests that whoever fired the missile knew that lots of people could be in harms way. But if the missile was designed to kill unarmed civilians waiting for a train then Western politicians are in no doubt that it would amount to a war crime.
