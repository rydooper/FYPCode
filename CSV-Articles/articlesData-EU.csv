Ukraine war: Dozens of Russian diplomats expelled by four EU nations,"More than 40 diplomats are told to leave by Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland and the Czech Republic.",Ukraine war: Dozens of Russian diplomats expelled by four EU nations Published 4 days ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmès told MPs that 21 Russian diplomats will be expelled In a co-ordinated move four EU countries are expelling more than 40 Russian diplomats suspected of spying. Ireland Belgium the Netherlands and the Czech Republic issued expulsion orders to a total of 43 embassy staffers on Tuesday afternoon. The move follows similar actions taken by other EU members including Poland in the past week. Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmès told MPs that the expulsions were related to our national security. Speaking to parliament Ms Wilmès said that 21 members of staff at the Russian embassy in Brussels and at the consulate in Antwerp had been asked to leave the country giving them two weeks to depart. She added that the move was made in conjunction with Belgium\s neighbour the Netherlands whose foreign ministry said it was expelling 17 Russian diplomats it considered to be secretly active as intelligence officers. Irelands Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Micheál Martin told MPs that his government had expelled four Russian diplomats after receiving security advice from its intelligence officials. Mr Martin said the officials had been asked to leave the state because their activities are not in accordance with the international standards of diplomatic behaviour. Russia\s embassy in Dublin said it rejected the groundless decision adding that it would deteriorate further Russian-Irish relations. Meanwhile a Czech official told the AFP news agency that the diplomat expelled from Prague was Russias deputy ambassador. Together with our Allies we are reducing the Russian intelligence presence in the EU the Czech foreign ministry tweeted. On Wednesday Poland expelled 45 accredited diplomats for engaging in suspected espionage in the country. Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski wrote on Twitter that Polish intelligence officials were dismantling the Russian special services network in our country. And earlier this month Bulgaria Lithuania Latvia and Estonia expelled a total of 20 Russian embassy staffers in connection with activities contrary to their diplomatic status. Russia has tended to respond to such decisions with reciprocal moves and earlier today announced the expulsion of 10 diplomats from Estonia Latvia and Lithuania.

EU signs US gas deal to curb reliance on Russia,The liquefied natural gas deal with US is part of EU attempts to reduce reliance on Russian energy.,EU signs US gas deal to curb reliance on Russia Published 25 March comments Comments Share IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES The US and the EU have announced a major deal on liquified natural gas in an attempt to reduce Europes reliance on Russian energy. The agreement will see the US provide the EU with extra gas equivalent to around 10% of the gas it currently gets from Russia by the end of the year. The bloc has already said it will cut Russian gas use in response to Russias invasion of Ukraine. Russia currently supplies about 40% of the EUs gas needs. The new deal will involve the US and other countries supplying an extra 15 billion cubic metres of gas on top of last years 22 billion cubic metres. The new total will represent around 24% of the gas currently imported from Russia. The eventual aim is for the US and international partners to provide about 50 billion cubic metres per year to the EU. Cutting reliance on Russia will mean generating more renewable energy and improving energy efficiency as well as increasing imports. Ukraine war: How reliant is the world on Russia for oil and gas? Why are gas bills so high and whats the energy price cap? The deal was announced on Friday during a three-day visit by US President Joe Biden to Brussels. Mr Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen discussed Russias invasion of Ukraine and offered fresh support to Kyiv. Putin is using Russia\s energy resources to coerce and manipulate its neighbours Mr Biden told reporters in Brussels. He\s used the profits to drive his war machine. He said the long term benefits of the deal would outweigh the short term pain that reducing Russian gas supplies would cause. I know that eliminating Russian gas will have costs for Europe but it\s not only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint it\s going to put us on a much stronger strategic footing. President von der Leyen said: We want as Europeans to diversify away from Russia towards suppliers that we trust that are friends and that are reliable. She pointed out that the target 50 billion cubic metres per year is replacing one-third already of the Russian gas going to Europe today. So we are right on track now to diversify away from Russian gas. The EU gets 40% of its gas from Russia. If its to wean itself off that dependency it needs to get its energy elsewhere. The question is where from? Gas is already piped from Norway - but those pipelines are already operating at maximum capacity. The EU gets relatively little from the North Sea. New supplies will have to come from further afield in the form of LNG - gas thats been chilled and liquified. But theres already intense competition for LNG supplies from countries such as Algeria and Qatar and thats been pushing up prices. The 50 billion cubic metres of gas a year from the US - more than double the current quantity - would certainly be welcome. But it still wouldnt fill the gap if Russian supplies were removed. There are also question marks over how much gas the US can supply how quickly it can increase exports to the EU - and how much those shipments will cost. The EU has been enjoying cheap gas for many years - but now it seems to have accepted that era is coming to an end. Russias war with Ukraine has helped push energy prices to record highs. Energy prices were already rising before the invasion as economies started to recover from the Covid crisis. The Ukraine invasion prompted the EU to pledge to cut Russian gas use by two-thirds this year by hiking imports from other countries and boosting renewable energy. The White House said that greater energy efficiency can be immediately achieved through increasing the use of smart thermostats and heat pumps. The EU said that reductions through energy savings in homes can replace 15.5 billion cubic metres this year and that accelerating wind and solar deployment can replace 20 billion cubic metres. The EUs goal is to save 170 billion cubic metres by 2030 through energy efficiency and by using renewable energy. That 170 billion on top of the planned 50 billion of additional gas from the US and other countries means Europes reliance on Russian gas could be replaced by 2030. Russia sanctions In response to Russias invasion of Ukraine the US is banning all Russian oil and gas imports and the UK will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. The EU has said it will switch to alternative supplies and make Europe independent from Russian energy well before 2030. Germany has put on hold permission for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to open. Meanwhile in the UK petrol prices have hit record highs as oil and gas costs soar. Oil jumped to $139 a barrel at one point earlier this month the highest level for almost 14 years while wholesale gas prices for next-day delivery more than doubled.]

UK minister seeks talks on scheme replacing EU aid fund,Neil O'Brien speaks after Welsh ministers complained of not being involved in plans for the fund.,UK minister seeks talks on scheme replacing EU aid fund By Felicity Evans Political editor Wales Published 23 March Share Related Topics Brexit IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption The A465 near Ebbw Vale was part funded by EU financial aid A UK minister says he has been seeking a meeting with the Welsh economy minister about a new fund to replace EU aid for Wales poorest areas. Minister for Levelling Up Neil O\Brien said he wanted to talk to Vaughan Gething but Welsh ministers were still mulling the offer of a meeting. Welsh ministers have criticised the UK government for not involving them in plans for the Shared Prosperity Fund. Welsh ministers said agreement can be reached based on joint decision making. What does levelling up mean for Wales? Wales to get £46m of EU funds replacement pilot Ministers in Cardiff have also complained that the fund leaves Wales worse off than under the original EU scheme. The details of how the new fund will work have yet to be announced. Mr O\Brien told a committee of Welsh MPs on Wednesday: I am keen to talk about it with my equivalent Vaughan Gething in Wales but at the moment I think they are still deciding if they want to engage in that way. Addressing the Welsh Affairs Committee he said he wanted the Welsh government to be involved in shaping the scheme but they are mulling how they want to play this. We are in the process of talking to Welsh local authorities and other stakeholders he said. I am keen to meet with and work with the Welsh government. Money in local leaders hands Mr OBrien said officials of the two governments were meeting regularly and Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove had met the first ministers of Wales and Scotland before Christmas. We are very open to the Welsh government shaping all the different dimensions of this fund he said. But he also added that UK ministers want local authorities to decide how to spend the money. The one thing we would be keen on and I think this is probably the thing that is making them wonder about whether to meet is that we really want to allocate the funding fully out to local regions within Wales. We\d like to put the money in the hands of local leaders. How has the Welsh government responded? A Welsh government spokesperson said: Welsh ministers have been clear in meetings and in public that an agreement can be reached on the basis of joint decision making. A credible agreement that works for jobs and communities in Wales must go beyond consultation and include a joint approach to the design and delivery of programmes and projects. Officials from both governments are in ongoing dialogue on these issues and Welsh ministers look forward to meeting with UK ministers to discuss their response to our offer of a way forward.

Brexit: 'More needed to explain impact of EU law on NI',A Lords committee warns more information is required on how legal updates will affect Northern Ireland.,Brexit: More needed to explain impact of EU law on NI By John Campbell BBC News NI Economics & Business Editor Published 22 March comments Comments Share Related Topics Brexit IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES/PAUL FAITH Image caption The protocol led to inspections at ports on certain goods imported into Northern Ireland from Great Britain The UK and EU need to do more to explain how updates to EU law could impact Northern Ireland a House of Lords committee has warned. A significant amount of EU law continues to apply in NI under the terms of the Protocol. That body of law is subject to constant technical update and revision. The Lords sub-committee on the protocol says far too much government documentation inadequately explains the implications of EU legislation for NI. The protocol is the Brexit deal that prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EUs single market for goods. That means many EU laws on product standards customs VAT and state aid continue to apply in Northern Ireland. If the EU is bringing forward entirely new laws which will affect Northern Ireland there is a formal consultation process with the UK government through the oversight body known as the Joint Committee. However if the EU is amending or replacing existing laws they automatically apply in Northern Ireland - what is known as dynamic regulatory alignment. In those cases the scrutiny process is based on the UK government producing explanatory memoranda (EM). Extremely poor The Lords sub-committee uses these EMs to decide which issues need detailed analysis. It says these EMs are of inconsistent quality describing some as extremely poor. It praises the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) for the quality of its submissions. However it adds: Too many documents from other departments do not contain sufficient information about the implications of EU legislation for Northern Ireland. The committee suggests the ongoing negotiations on the protocol are being used as an excuse to provide minimal information. Notwithstanding the ongoing discussions... the government has an obligation in the meantime to set out the full implications of EU legislation applying to Northern Ireland under the protocol as it currently operates it says. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? UK and Irish prime ministers discuss protocol What is Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol? The committee also tackles the wider issue of the protocol\s democratic deficit. That refers to the fact that the EU laws which continue to apply in Northern Ireland are not subject to any consent from parliamentarians either at Westminster or Stormont. In October the EU published proposals aimed at enhancing consultation with Northern Ireland business and civic groups. It also said it is planning a website showing EU legislation applicable to Northern Ireland which could include information on pending public consultations for relevant measures. Particular needs The committee says these measures are welcome as far as they go but the EU needs to do more. It suggests a number of ideas such as providing a means for the Northern Ireland Assembly to express a collective view or decision on EU legislation. IMAGE SOURCE PETER DAZELEY/GETTY Image caption If the EU is amending or replacing existing laws they automatically apply in Northern Ireland That could take the form of pre-legislative consultation or a Legislative Consent Mechanism - a non-binding Stormont vote. The EU is likely to be resistant to measures which would give Stormont greater rights than EEA countries - they are non-EU single market participants like Norway. However the committee\s chairman Lord Jay of Ewelme told the BBC that Northern Ireland\s situation was not comparable with the EEA and there does need to be something which takes account of the particular needs of Northern Ireland at a very sensitive time.]
Morlais tidal project on Anglesey gets £31m EU funding,The sum is likely to be the last large grant from the EU's regional funding programme.,Morlais tidal project on Anglesey gets £31m EU funding Published 22 March Share IMAGE SOURCE BLEDDYN JONES-PEARSON Image caption The Morlais scheme in Anglesey aims to develop tidal power generation technologies A major tidal project off Anglesey will benefit from £31m of funding in what is likely to be the last large grant from the EUs regional funding programme. Wales Climate Change Minister Julie James confirmed the funding would be given to Menter Môn for the Morlais infrastructure project. The project aims to develop tidal power generation technologies by providing grid connectivity. It is also expected to create jobs and boost skills in the area. Action on green energy needed now says trade body Power project could be devastating for seabirds No better time to seek investors says deal boss The Morlais project would see a development on 35 sq km (13 sq miles) of seabed generating up to 240MW of electricity from the power of the tides in the Irish Sea. It would make it one of the largest tidal stream energy sites in the world. But environmentalists have warned the plans could have a devastating impact on seabird populations. The Crown Estate will invest a further £1.2m in the Morlais project to support the delivery of its environmental monitoring and mitigation package. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption There are concerns about the impact of the project on local wildlife Ms James said the project is an opportunity for the industry to establish clean resilient and ethical power as a significant part of the global energy system. North Wales minister Lesley Griffiths added: Anglesey and north Wales as a whole are very well placed to play a key role in innovative low carbon energy generation which benefits local communities. Not only will the project be a boost to future low carbon energy production but will also generate jobs and skills in the area. Unlocking the tidal stream sector Wales economy minister Vaughan Gething said there have been considerable opportunities for the marine energy sector through European structural fund programmes. There is no doubt EU funds have been essential in supporting businesses to exploit the great potential of Wales\ wave and tidal resources with a significant investment of £105m in marine energy projects in Wales he said. The Morlais infrastructure project is key to unlocking the development of the tidal stream sector in north Wales bringing a number of economic benefits to the region. With the construction and testing of devices and preparation of infrastructure the project will attract further sector investment enabling the supply chain to grow and with it create higher-skilled jobs.]

Now EU leaders who are here for a two-day summit hope to project an image of unity in the face of Russian aggression in Ukraine. Thats easy when they discuss the big picture. But some details up for debate are clearly divisive amongst member states: such as energy prices impacted by the war EU common defence plans and the enlargement of the bloc to include Ukraine. Yet the bureaucratic often bickering behemoth that is the EU has already been transformed by the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Lets take a step back to get some perspective: Germany is re-booting its military after decades of squeamishness due to the countrys role in World War Two The EU has slapped unprecedented financial sanctions on Russia despite costs to European businesses The EUs Temporary Protection Directive has been used for the first time to help Ukrainian refugees work and live in the bloc- a divisive topic during the 2015 migrant crisis Brussels is buying and supplying weapons for the first time ever to a country at war The Energy Transition - so often put on a backburner by EU countries - promises to be a revolution with new plans to reduce heavy reliance on Russian gas EU outliers Poland and Hungary in Brussels bad books for years are back in the fold as a result of the current crisis Brussels cooperation and co-ordination with Nato and the US are smoother and closer than theyve been in a long time Is this a temporary blip or are we looking at a Brussels rebirth; an EU 2.0? The EU was already aware - certainly after the 2016 Brexit vote if not before - that it needed some serious self-improvement. The bloc was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize back in 2012 for over six decades contributing to the advancement of peace and reconciliation democracy and human rights in Europe. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption EU member states have sent defensive weapons to Ukraine but face demands for greater support But in the eyes of many Europeans Brussels became seen as a home for neo-liberalism rather than liberalism. A promoter of trade deals prioritising big business and a maker of dirty migrant deals (with Turkey for example) to keep refugees from reaching EU shores. A bloc that along with many national governments was perceived as helping banks instead of families after the 2008 economic crisis. An entity decades after the Second World War that had lost its vision mission and recognition as a force for peace in Europe. Populism nationalism and illiberalism became familiar faces in European politics as voters looked for a better fit. EU countries fell out over migration eurozone reform and more. Conspiracy theories flourished as trust in Brussels and traditional politicians waned. Strongman leaders like Hungary\s Viktor Orban Turkey\s Recep Erdogan America\s Donald Trump and Russia\s Vladimir Putin were increasingly admired. Then in 2020 the Covid pandemic prompted a reset. After an unedifying start Brussels was perceived as working in the public interest. Member states seemed more united opinion polls were approving. The EUs Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell has appealed to EU leaders to display the same drive and resolve shown in face of Covid when dealing with the Russia-Ukraine crisis and resulting challenges. This war on European soil has refocused EU minds as to what the bloc could - or should - stand for. Vladimir Putins assault on Ukraine is also seen by the EU majority as a geopolitical attack on European security as a whole. EPA The war in Ukraine is an immense trauma a human political humanitarian drama and its undoubtedly an element thatll lead to completely redefining the architecture of our Europe Emmanuel Macron French President But this two-day informal summit could well expose cracks in this new-found EU unity. All EU leaders fret about rising energy costs and the impact back home of Russia sanctions and possible counter sanctions. But they disagree on what to do about it. Some call for an EU-wide solution - that is new funds from Brussels. Others like Germany and the Netherlands say no. Emmanuel Macron is the host of the summit since France currently holds the rotating EU presidency. Hes long been a champion of a stronger more independent Europe weaning itself off food technology and energy imports and building up its own defence force to work alongside Nato. But the prospect of a European Army (under French command) remains an unlikely prospect. Instead EU countries will discuss better co-ordination and the pooling of military resources... while likely arguing over which nations should win the best contracts.

That is what is at stake now Olaf Scholz (R) German Chancellor As for migration. two million Ukrainians have already fled the country. Depending on how long the misery and violence continue many more could arrive in the EU. Diplomats Ive spoken to predict that funding housing and relocating millions across different member states could yet prove difficult longer term.

Climate change: EU unveils plan to end reliance on Russian gas,The EU Commission outlines an ambitious roadmap to cut imports of Russian gas by two thirds in a year.,Climate change: EU unveils plan to end reliance on Russian gas By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Published 8 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE NATHAN STIRK As countries scramble to reduce their reliance on Russias oil and gas in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine few places are as exposed as the European Union. The EU gets roughly 40% of its gas from Russia: According to figures from research group Transport & Environment this dependence costs around $118m a day. But moving with a speed few thought possible the EU has now laid out a strategy that could cut reliance on this fuel source by two thirds within a year. The REPowerEU plan aims to make Europe independent of Russian fossil fuels by 2030 but the initial efforts focus solely on gas. The roadmap essentially proposes finding alternative supplies of gas in the next few months and boosting energy efficiency while doubling down on greener sources of power in the medium to longer term. It\s hard bloody hard said EU Commission vice president Frans Timmermans. But it\s possible if we\re willing to go further and faster than we\ve done before. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Part of the Yamal pipeline that brings gas from Russia to Europe The Commissions new proposals will make it a legal requirement for EU countries to ensure they have a minimum level of gas storage. The aim is to have gas stocks at 90% of capacity by the Autumn up from around 30% now. Discussions are ongoing with existing gas suppliers including Norway Algeria and Azerbaijan to boost flows. The plan envisages ending reliance on all Russian fossil fuels well before 2030. In the short term gas should be sourced from the US and Africa while some countries may need to use more coal in the months ahead. The EU also proposes a massive ramping up of renewables biogas and hydrogen. Unite against climate change - Ukraine scientist World warned of irreversible climate impacts While carbon emissions may rise in the short term the longer-term aim is a speedier transition to sustainable sources. Another key focus in the coming months will be increased imports of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) from suppliers including the US Qatar and Australia. But with Germany announcing plans for two new LNG terminals to increase supplies some experts are worried that this could increase longer term dependency on fossil fuels. I think we\re living in a tricky time that there\s so much political pressure to make these energy policy decisions said Prof Paula Kivimaa from the Finnish Environment Institute and the University of Sussex. But we also must look beyond the next couple of years. If Germany builds new LNG infrastructure there is a risk that it kind of locks it in for the foreseeable future. As well as diversifying gas supplies the Commission also believes the reliance on Russia will be eased as there are new renewable energy projects due to come online. The EU says that countries should look to use the revenues raised from the Emissions Trading Scheme which have almost doubled since 2020 to pay for these green energy sources. But in the next few months dirtier energy sources like coal may also be needed. There is some capacity from the power sector to generate more electricity with coal and biofuels and there\s also some new wind and solar products coming online said Carlos Torres Diaz head of gas and power markets research at analysts Rystad Energy. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Rooftop solar power could meet a quarter of EU electricity needs So this could be a way of reducing some of the gas consumption as the power sector is the largest consumer of gas. This could be done within this year. Frans Timmermans recognised that for some countries it might make sense to switch to coal in the short term but this could bring its own difficulties. Europe gets around 30% of its coal from Russia. Alternative supplies from countries like South Africa and Columbia are not easily obtained. Any switch to coal would also rapidly boost carbon emissions a trend thats already well underway. We\ve already seen the emissions from coal increase last year because of an increase of 18% in coal power generation said Carlos Torres Diaz. So if this continues during 2022 emissions will continue to rise because coal power generation has more or less twice as much emissions as gas generation. The Commission document also says that renewable energy projects must be fast tracked and says there is huge potential in domestic rooftop solar power. Up to a quarter of the blocs electricity consumption could be generated from panels on homes farms and commercial building the Commission says. To reduce reliance on natural gas from whatever source the Commission is also calling for a huge ramp up in biogas which is made from agricultural and food waste. With the extra investment in renewables this could also lead to a significant increase in green hydrogen which can be made from wind and solar power. The Commission is now calling for a quadrupling of hydrogen use by 2030. They would have gravitated towards green hydrogen over the next couple of decades up to 2050 that sort of timescale said Mike Foster Chief Executive of the UK trade body Energy and Utilities Alliance. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption A German biogas plant which generates methane from animal and food waste Actually this crisis has brought it to a head and you\re probably going to get decisions made in the 2020s to bring it all forward at least 10 years. There may well be some dissenting voices when EU leaders meet in Versailles later this week. They will all recognise that all these proposed changes will not come cheap. Campaigners say that Europes governments must ensure the very poorest are protected. In parallel with introducing sanctions a huge package of support must be deployed to ensure that they do not deepen Europe\s ongoing energy poverty crisis and that no one has to choose between heating and eating said Mike Davis from Global Witness who are calling for a full oil and gas embargo on Russia. The need for everyone to be able to afford to heat their home must come before worries about economic growth. The Commission will be encouraging countries to use a toolbox of measures to protect consumers including windfall taxes on the profits of energy companies. But while the poorest may receive some protection in the short term there will be added pain on the price front. I don\t see a simple way for to shield the consumers from the costs that all of this transition will imply said Carlos Torres Diaz from Rystad. Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.

NI Protocol: Edwin Poots wants EU pressed on seeds importation rules,The agriculture minster wants more cereals and potatoes grown locally in response to the Ukraine war.,NI Protocol: Edwin Poots wants EU pressed on seeds importation rules By John Campbell BBC News NI Economics & Business Editor Published 10 March Share Related Topics Brexit IMAGE SOURCE PHOTOATTRACTIVE Image caption Northern Irelands agriculture minister wants more wheat barley and potatoes grown locally Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots has asked the UK government to press the EU to relax rules on importing agriculture seeds to Northern Ireland. Mr Poots says he wants farmers to grow more cereal crops and potatoes in response to the Ukraine war. Ukraine and Russia are major exporters of basic foodstuffs and the war has hit crop production driving up prices. The seeds trade comes under the Northern Ireland Protocol and involves an onerous import process. Mr Poots told the BBC: We\re looking at a situation where we\re going to have a shortage of wheat and barley and that will lead to all sorts of problems. So I want to see more wheat barley and potatoes grown in NI. You\ve grace periods on quite a number of things. I want grace periods on seeds and plants products. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem UK and EU determined to find durable solutions The NI Protocol and its economic impact The Ulster Farmers Union (UFU) has previously complained that new inspection and certification processes were limiting the varieties of seed available from Great Britain. The organisation has also said it was becoming uneconomical to order smaller quantities of seeds. Under the protocol there is an outright prohibition on moving seed potatoes from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland produces relatively little cereal with agriculture more focused on livestock. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption The Republic of Ireland imports about 5.5m tonnes of grain a year equivalent to 60% of supply Official figures suggest that in 2020 only about 1% of farms in Northern Ireland were classified as being predominately cereal producers. The total output of field crops was estimated at £62m whereas livestock output was estimated at £1.8bn. Earlier this week Irelands minister for agriculture Charlie McConalogue had called on farmers to grow more cereal crops. Ireland imports about 5.5m tonnes of grain a year equivalent to 60% of supply. Minister McConalogue said it was fortunate that Ireland was still early in the planting season providing the opportunity to grow more grain. However farm organisations have been lukewarm on the proposal. Tim Cullinan president of the Irish Farmers\ Association said: It is far from certain that asking all farmers to plant crops is the best use of the resources that are likely to be available to us.]

Brexit: UK and EU 'still determined to find solutions to protocol',The joint committee met on Tuesday to discuss issues around the Northern Ireland Protocol.,Brexit: UK and EU still determined to find solutions to protocol By John Campbell BBC News NI Economics & Business Editor Published 8 March comments Comments Share Related Topics Brexit IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES The UK and EU said they remain determined to find durable solutions to the issues around the Northern Ireland Protocol. The two sides issued a joint statement after a meeting of senior officials. The negotiators met in a body known as the Specialised Committee. It deals with technical issues and can make recommendations to the lead negotiators UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commission Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič. The statement said: Both parties underlined their ongoing determination to ensure that outstanding issues in the context of the protocol are addressed and durable solutions are found as soon as possible for the benefit of people and businesses in Northern Ireland. In addition the EU and the UK reiterated the importance of further engagement with business groups civil society and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland and committed to further joint engagements. Officials representing the NI Executive attended the meeting as part of the UK delegation. IMAGE SOURCE JOHANNA GERON/REUTERS Image caption British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commissioner in charge of Brexit negotiations Maroš Šefčovič The protocol is the Brexit deal which prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EUs single market for goods. That also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK something the EU accepts is causing difficulties for many businesses. The EU has agreed in principle that GB goods which are going to stay in Northern Ireland should be subject to fewer checks and controls than those which are due to travel onwards to the Republic of Ireland and the wider EU. But there is still a big difference between the UK and EU about how that should be implemented and what should be considered a reasonable level of risk to the EU single market. The NI Protocol and its economic impact A simple guide to the Brexit border problem The joint committee previously met in late February. At that time Mrs Truss and Mr Šefčovič said they were determined that outstanding issues would be addressed. A senior EU official suggested that the talks would happen in a more discreet way in the run up to the Northern Ireland Assembly elections in May. It is not yet clear if or how the war in Ukraine will affect the negotiations. Mrs Truss and Mr Šefčovič have previously made a joint statement expressing a wish for a positive EU-UK relationship which would allow for co-operation on common global challenges. Last week Mrs Truss was a guest at an emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels alongside the US secretary of state and Canadas foreign minister. However EU and UK sources have both played down the prospect that the changed environment could unlock rapid progress.]
"UK owes EU money over customs fraud, court rules",European judges say the tax authorities did not collect correct taxes on imports of undervalued Chinese clothing.,UK owes EU money over customs fraud court rules Published 8 March Share IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS The UK faces making a potentially hefty payment to the EU after its top court ruled it did too little to prevent fraud on imports of Chinese clothing. European judges said HMRC failed to pass on the correct amount of tax revenue to the EU on imports between 2011 and 2017. The European Commission took legal action in 2018 arguing it was owed €2.7bn (£2.4bn). The UK government said it would respond to the judgement in due course. The UK was accused of taking inadequate steps to prevent fraud after it was warned about the problem by the EUs watchdog Olaf in 2017. EU member states had been warned by Olaf about the risk of undervalued clothing and footwear coming from China via shell companies. EU seeks £2.4bn customs duties from UK MEPs back probe on unpaid UK tariffs A quick guide to whats in the Brexit deal In a ruling on Tuesday the European Court of Justice (ECJ) upheld the commissions claim the UK had not paid the correct tax revenue to the EU. However it did not agree with how the commission calculated what exactly it is owed. The commission will now have to recalculate a final claim. EU members have to pass on a share of the taxes that they collect on imports to the commission as part of their contribution to the EU budget. The BBC has asked the commission for a comment. A UK government spokesperson said: Throughout we\ve made the case that we took reasonable and proportionate steps to tackle the fraud in question and that the Commission vastly overstated the size and severity of the alleged fraud. The UK has always and continues to take customs fraud very seriously and evolves its response as new threats emerge. The UK cut formal ties with the EU in January 2021 following an 11-month transition period after it officially left the bloc. However the ECJ retains the power to make rulings over cases relating to how the UK applied EU law before Brexit took place.]

Katya Adler Europe editor @BBCkatyaadler on Twitter Published 7 March Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline was an early casualty of Germanys change of heart over Russia You know that feeling when youre running downhill going so fast that you seem to lose control of your own feet? Thats where the EU appears to be at the moment. Crushing financial sanctions on Russia that hurt European business. Brussels purchasing and sending weapons to a non-EU country at war. Germany beefing up its military despite post-World War Two queasiness. Staunchly neutral Finland and Sweden thinking of joining Nato. The blocs asylum procedure pushed aside to accommodate fleeing Ukrainians in whats described as Europes biggest refugee crisis since 1945. Once dismissed as impossible - or at least hugely improbable - from one day to the next EU revolutions provoked by the Russia-Ukraine crisis have been happening thick and fast. The next seismic change bubbling in Brussels? A looming energy revolution provoked by a simple question: Whats the point of punitive financial sanctions if Vladimir Putins war chest is refilled on a daily basis with oil and gas revenues? The EU depends on Russia for 40% of its natural gas and a quarter of its oil imports. EU countries pay about €1bn a day to Moscow for those supplies according to Bruegel the Brussels-based think tank. The US - which is far less reliant on Russian energy supplies than Europe - says its considering banning Russian oil imports as part of its sanctions against the Kremlin. On Monday standing next to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken Lithuania\s foreign minister agreed. We cannot pay for oil and gas with Ukrainian blood he said. Price woes and the electorate Along with other eastern European Nato and EU members Lithuania views Vladimir Putin - with his ambitions to change Europes geopolitical order in Moscows favour - as an active security threat. The West must fight Russia with all means available said Lithuania\s president. To avoid World War Three. But other EU countries such as big powers Germany and Italy - far more reliant on Russian energy than most - feel more threatened by the prospect of skyrocketing energy prices that would surely follow any sanctions on Russian oil or gas imports. Energy prices are already painfully high across the continent. Until Russias attacks on Ukraine the majority of Germans supported Nord Stream 2 their new gas pipeline direct from Russia. The pipeline has been frozen as part of EU sanctions against Russia but Berlin fears public opinion could turn if Germans suddenly cant fill their cars with petrol or afford to heat their homes. Germanys Federation of Industries the BDI has warned that soaring prices could crush the EUs largest economy forcing factory and other German business closures with a rippling effect across the single market. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Anti-nuclear sentiment has always been strong in Germany Frances Emmanuel Macron is nervous too. He hopes to be re-elected president next month. The last time he was blamed for petrol price hikes in France it sparked months of massive street protests by the gilets jaunes the yellow jackets so-called because of the high-visibility vests they wore. So while on the world stage President Macron presents himself as the European champion of carbon neutrality energy prices are such a sensitive issue in France that he introduced €100 bonuses for the poorest voters this winter to mitigate fossil fuel prices as part of his re-election bid. Its notable too that French energy giant Total says its staying put in Russia for now despite the Kremlins onslaught against Ukraine while competitors BP and Shell have voluntarily pulled out. Ukraine needs EU action now So are energy sanctions against Russia just the latest example of an EU impossible that will suddenly become reality? The issue will be discussed in the European Parliament on Tuesday and among EU leaders at their Thursday summit. When I speak to EU naysayers they talk defensively not only about the dangers of domestic blowback but also potential aftershocks in the global energy market. At the moment we\re speaking with one voice alongside Latin America regarding Russian aggression one diplomat told me. But what would happen if the Argentine economy implodes as a result of energy price hikes and scarcity and the EU and the West is blamed for that? So for the moment the EU is clinging to what it views as safer ground. On Monday EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc would be speeding up efforts to wean itself off Russian energy. These include: finding reliable alternative suppliers (such as Qatar and Azerbaijan) improving energy efficiency eg renovating buildings and using artificial intelligence to effectively manage the energy grid massive investment in renewables such as solar wind and hydrogen already planned under the European Green Deal. Russias actions in Ukraine mean Brussels now views the Climate Question as a question of security. Energy security. Germanys new chancellor took the worlds breath away a week ago by reversing his countrys defence policy sending weapons to Ukraine and announcing a €100bn investment in the German military. His finance minister has also announced a €200bn investment in renewable and alternative energy sources. Germanys need is acute as it has all but phased out nuclear energy as well as phasing out coal. But those plans for renewable energies alternative suppliers and a clean energy divorce from Russia will take time. Something Ukraine just does not have.

Ukraine invasion: EU shuts airspace to Russian planes,"Russian planes will now be unable to land in, take off from or fly over any EU nation.",Ukraine invasion: EU shuts airspace to Russian planes Published 27 February Share The EU has imposed a blanket flight ban on Russian planes the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has announced. We are shutting down EU airspace for Russian-owned Russian-registered or Russian-controlled aircraft she said. All such planes including the private jets of oligarchs will now be unable to land in take off from or fly over any EU nation. Russian planes have also been banned from UK airspace. Russias biggest airline Aeroflot said it would cancel all flights to European destinations until further notice in a retaliatory move on Sunday. Ahead of the decision European countries had been closing their airspace one by one. Germany said its ban would last three months. Departure boards at Moscows Domodedovo and Sheremetyevo airports showed dozens of cancellations on Sunday including flights to Paris Vienna and Kaliningrad. Russias S7 Airlines said on Facebook it would cancel flights to many of its European destinations until at least 13 March. Russia has been responding with tit-for-tat restrictions on countries banning its flights. The Commission president said that the EU was also going to ban Russia\s state-owned news outlets Sputnik and Russia Today widely seen as a mouthpiece for the Kremlin. We are developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe she said. Is Russias invasion going as expected? Zelensky: A president rising to the moment Miles of queues at borders to flee invasion The restrictions on flights will require Russian airlines to take circuitous routes resulting in longer flight times. Commercial airlines are also avoiding airspace around Ukraine Moldova and Belarus following Russias invasion. In the US Delta Air Lines said it would suspend a flight booking agreement with Russias Aeroflot. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption All Russian-registered planes will be affected by the flight ban The UKs ban on Russian flights led Moscow to retaliate with a similar curb on British planes. Virgin Atlantic said avoiding Russia would add between 15 minutes and an hour to its flights between the UK and India and Pakistan. Australian airline Qantas said it would use a longer route for its direct flight between Darwin and London that does not overfly Russia.

"Ukraine war: Europe's new security era, faced with Russian threat","Many commentators say Ukraine's war has united Europe as hasn't been seen in years, but are they right?",Ukraine war: Europes new security era faced with Russian threat Katya Adler Europe editor @BBCkatyaadler on Twitter Published 11 hours ago Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image caption A banner of Russian President Vladimir Putin next to the Moscow embassy in Riga Latvia Era defining new reality historic moment - that\s where we are right now in Europe. At least that\s what countless European politicians and commentators say since Russian President Vladimir Putin began his invasion of Ukraine. Are they right? Yes and No Id argue. Starting with the Yes. On 24 February President Putin shocked this continent out of complacency. His assault on Ukraine has brought large-scale death and destruction back to Europe including whispers of possible nuclear war. His aim: not only to dominate Ukraine but to roll back Western dominance militarily and - ideally - politically in terms of liberal democracy from the former Soviet sphere of influence. The action Western allies take together now will fundamentally affect Europeans sense of self and safety for years to come. Nato is re-invigorated. The transatlantic military alliance once dismissed by French President Emmanuel Macron as brain dead is simultaneously proving Mr Putin wrong to view the West as weak and disunited while also providing military support defence and deterrence to Nato\s eastern flank that feels so exposed to the Kremlin\s expansionist fervour. This - so far - is also proving to be a defining moment for the EU. The bloc had long talked up playing a bigger role on the world stage - and not solely in terms of economics and trade. Until now that was a failed ambition. But the Russia-Ukraine crisis has unexpectedly elevated the EU into a credible geopolitical player. The speed with which Brussels co-ordinated sanctions against Russia - both within the EU and with international allies - was frankly impressive. As were the unity of resolve amongst member states and the bureaucracy-defying EU moves to enact never-before-used mechanisms to help Ukrainian refugees and the Ukrainian military. Germany one of the EUs biggest players also took the worlds breath away by suddenly saying goodbye to World War Two sensitivities and announcing huge investments in its military the Bundeswehr. Key to the decision being applauded in the EU and further afield is that this is not a Germany newly flexing nationalist muscles. This is about Germany helping to re-define Europe not its own role Ricarda Lang told me. She is the co-chair of the German Green Party in the coalition government. It\s about European sovereignty not just in security and defence but also in terms of imports and energy. For years Germany has knowingly been reliant on the US for security and on Russia for energy and trade. It is not the only EU country in that position. But as the blocs richest and most powerful nation Berlin is the most stand-out example. And this has weakened the Wests hand when it comes to sanctions against Russia. EU countries pay Moscow up to €800m (£674m; $884m) for energy every day which amounts to an estimated 40% of the Kremlins income. This money goes towards funding the war against Ukraine that the West is ostensibly fighting. It\s tragic it took a war like this but now we Germans have woken up with a bang! insists Marie Agnes Strack-Zimmerman who heads the German parliament\s Defence Committee. She assured me Berlin was now ready to take responsibility. Image caption We Germans have woken up with a bang! said the chairwoman of the German parliaments Defence Committee The West looked at Germany with suspicion after two world wars she observed but that was decades ago and - to be honest she said - Germany was pretty comfortable enjoying being a Nato and EU member without having to invest in its own army. Germany\s allies have waited too long for us to do our bit. Berlin has now pledged to build an efficient modern military and to keep up defence spending to Nato requirements. Under international pressure trade and energy ties are being tackled too. Bear in mind though that transforming the currently threadbare German military will take years as will untangling the country from its deep-seated relations with Russia. For decades Berlin was the dividing line between East and West Europe. Hopes for European unity were high after the fall of the iconic Berlin Wall and the ensuing 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union. But fast-forward 30 years and you hear talk of a new Berlin Wall though further to the east. Tiny Baltic country Latvia has a 200km (124 mile)-long border fence separating the EU and Nato member on one side from expansionist Russia on the other. Col Sandris Gaugers is the commander of the Latvian Land Forces Mechanized Infantry Brigade. We spoke at his military base just outside the capital Riga. The base is also home to Nato forces which have almost doubled in size since Russia invaded Ukraine. Image caption Col Sandris Gaugers said priorities have changed across Europe I see a new Iron Curtain coming. Though this time we\ll be on the western side the colonel told me. We are living a new reality. For us Latvians the security environment is now gone. We spent 20 years in Iraq in Afghanistan. Now our main focus is here. How do we defend our freedom and our country? Priorities have now changed across Europe he said. People used to focus on economic wealth. Now it\s about defending our values and way of life. Latvians and their Baltic neighbours in Estonia and Lithuania are trying hard not to say I-told-you-so to the West. They\ve been warning about President Putin for years. They feel they understand the Russian leader better than most. All three countries were once part of the Soviet Union. Latvia\s Prime Minister Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš insists the West has to accept that Putin is not like us. France and German leaders famously went on diplomatic visits to Moscow earlier this year trying to dissuade President Putin from attacking Ukraine. Prime Minister Kariņš says agonising over finding the right words or turns of phrase to persuade Mr Putin is pointless. He\s hell-bent on destroying democracy and our way of life. If we don\t stop Putin. He will not stop at Ukraine. Mr Kariņš said the one good thing to come out of the current situation is that Nato and the EU are working closer together than they have in 30 years. That he said was a game-changer. And here we come back to whether this is an era-defining moment for Europe. Or maybe not. The EU is thrilled to have the US back and engaged in Europe. For all Brussels\ talk of the bloc now building strategic sovereignty in defence and security EU countries look to Washington when faced with Russian threats. Image caption Training session at the Adazi military base in Latvia EU defence plans designed to complement - or to partly replace - Nato depending which European politician you speak to are nothing new. And so far theyve never worked. All EU countries agree that at the very least it makes sense to pool resources and know-how: cyber military equipment and intelligence. Yet no nation wants to go first. Each EU member has businesses or individuals benefiting from national contracts. The European Commission now wants to oversee the overhaul of defence capabilities. Few in the military are holding their breath wherever they reside in Europe. As regards the renaissance in EU-Nato co-operation in all likelihood once the acute Russia-Ukraine crisis subsides the US will turn its attention to what it truly sees as its foreign policy priority: the Asia-Pacific not Europe. But the EU has its raison dêtre back. Designed originally as a peace project its vision fell by the wayside in recent times. Younger Europeans had no memory of war. They saw no urgency in uniting or fighting for peace on their continent. In that regard this moment really is a new reality. Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Nato Vladimir Putin European Union]

Ukraine crisis: Tough and emotional summit as EU leaders seek unity,"Former Iron Curtain countries feel exposed, but some EU leaders argue against ""nuclear"" measures.",Ukraine crisis: Tough and emotional summit as EU leaders seek unity Katya Adler Europe editor @BBCkatyaadler on Twitter Published 25 February Share Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Just before the emergency EU leaders meeting on Ukraine started a Brussels official told us he thought this would be one of the toughest and most emotional EU summits ever. From what I heard went on behind closed doors he wasnt wrong. Russias actions in Ukraine impact many EU members directly. It feels personal to them. Their belief: that Vladimir Putin has his eye on much more than Ukraine - that he wants to redesign the security architecture of Europe in his favour. Countries in central and eastern Europe which used to be behind the Iron Curtain - now EU and Nato members - feel very exposed. Particularly the Baltic States which border Russia. They fear the Kremlin intends to destabilise them with cyber attacks and more disinformation campaigns aimed at their ethnic Russian communities. Russia attacks Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS: Why is Putin invading Ukraine? FROM KYIV: BBC Ukraine editor: There is no safe place any more FROM MOSCOW: Shock and support in Russian capital IN MAPS: How Russia carried out the invasion On his way into Thursday nights summit the Polish prime minister voiced deep frustration that tougher sanctions hadnt been imposed earlier on Moscow. Enough of this cheap talking snapped Mateusz Morawiecki. Europe continues buying so much Russian oil and gas he said. And he Vladimir Putin] is turning it into aggression invasion. He\s destabilising all of Europe. But other EU leaders pulled in a different direction. True all 27 of them unanimously agreed to an unprecedented sanctions package described by the European Council president as massive and painful against Russia. The package targets more sectors of the Russian economy including the transport and energy sectors (with a ban on exports from Europe that Russia depends on to refine its oil for sale) as well as the financial sector and more individuals close to the Kremlin. EU leaders also agreed to slap sanctions on Belarus a key Putin ally. But the sanctions and counter-sanctions threatened by Russia will hit European economies too. Some more than others making them wary. Germany and Italy - so reliant on Russian gas supplies and business ties - urged the EU to hold back on the toughest sanctions of all for now like limiting oil and gas imports and ejecting Russia from the Swift international payment system. Berlin and Rome argue it\s wiser to keep those nuclear measures as they\re known up the EU\s sleeve in case the situation worsens in Ukraine. Their critics accuse them of self-interest in a time of international crisis. Emotional but dignified Hungary Romania and Poland meanwhile voiced other concerns at the summit. Direct neighbours of Ukraine they worry theyll find themselves on the front line of a new migration crisis should Ukrainians try to flee the hostilities in large numbers. Brussels says its working both on contingency plans to help refugees and to compensate EU countries worst hit by sanctions and resulting further spiralling energy prices. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption People arriving from Kyiv sheltered inside a railway station in Poland on Thursday The message the EU hoped to transmit on Thursday was one of unity: externally with warnings to Russia and assurances of solidarity to Ukraine. EU leaders heard what\s described as an emotional but dignified address by Ukraine\s president via video conference. But also internally - to show all member states that theyre in this crisis together. For the long haul. Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Russia Vladimir Putin European Union Ukraine]

Fast fashion: European Union reveals fast fashion crackdown,Fast fashion could be a thing of the past under plans to make clothing worn in the EU more sustainable.,Fast fashion: European Union reveals fast fashion crackdown By Helen Briggs Environment correspondent Published 3 days ago Share Related Topics Climate change IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption Fashion production has a big impact on climate Clothes furniture and smartphones sold in Europe must be longer-lasting and easier to repair under new rules proposed by the European Union. The strategy launched on Wednesday targets products at every stage of use including design repair and recycling. The initiative aims to boost the market for sustainably made textiles. It also says it will crack down on companies misleading consumers with false environmental claims or greenwashing. Manufacturers will have to ensure their clothes are eco-friendly and hard-wearing. And consumers will be given more information on how to reuse repair and recycle their clothes. Iona Popescu of environmental NGO the Environmental Coalition on Standards said the rules were designed to bring in longer-lasting products that could be used multiple times rather than worn a few times then thrown away. The Commission seeks to put a halt on fast fashion by introducing rules on textiles to be used in the European market she said. IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES Image caption The global fashion industry is estimated to have produced around 2.1 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2018 Its estimated that less than 1% of all clothing worldwide is recycled. What is fast fashion? Can sustainable fashion turn the red carpet green? Could ditching fast fashion make us happier? According to the European Environment Agency clothes use in Europe has on average the fourth highest impact on the environment and climate exceeded only by food housing and transport. For every person in the EU textile consumption requires nine cubic metres of water 400 square metres of land 391kg of raw materials and causes a carbon footprint of about 270kg. In the UK politicians have called on the government to change the law to require fashion retailers to comply with environmental standards. The government rejected most of the Environmental Audit Committees recommendations in 2019 including making clothes producers pay for better clothing collection and recycling but has made textile waste a priority. Tamara Cincik of the think tank for the fashion industry Fashion Roundtable said the textiles strategy could set the tone for future legislation outside of the EU. If expectations of brands in the UK compared to the EU diverge this will hopefully encourage stronger expectations of future UK legislation she said. This is why it is so important for both UK brands and the government to be alert to this strategy as the EU remains our largest and indeed closest trading partner for the textiles and fashion industry. The proposals will now be discussed by the Council and European Parliament.

Ukraine: EU deploys cyber rapid-response team,"Cyber-security experts from six countries are deployed, after Ukraine calls for help in defence against Russia.",Ukraine: EU deploys cyber rapid-response team By Joe Tidy Cyber reporter Published 22 February Share IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES A cyber rapid-response team (CRRT) is being deployed across Europe after a call for help from Ukraine. The newly formed team of eight to 12 experts from Lithuania Croatia Poland Estonia Romania and the Netherlands has committed to help defend Ukraine from cyber-attacks - remotely and on site in the country. An official warned attacks were likely. We can see that cyber-measures are an important part of Russia\s hybrid toolkit the CRRT official said. It comes after the UK and the US blamed Russia for cyber-attacks earlier this month that temporarily took a small number of Ukrainian banking and government websites offline. Why is Putin ordering troops into Ukraine? UK warned to bolster defences against cyber attacks EU wants emergency team for cyber-attacks The Lithuanian Ministry of Defence tweeted: In response to Ukraine request we] are activating a] Lithuanian-led cyber rapid-response team which will help Ukrainian institutions to cope with growing cyber-threats. #StandWithUkraine. CRRTs are a European Union initiative to deepen defence and co-operation between member states. They are said to be equipped with commonly developed cyber-toolkits designed to detect recognise and mitigate cyber-threats. An official said the team was composed of different cyber-expertise such as incident response forensics vulnerability assessment to be able to react to a variety of scenarios. Russia has previously been accused of so-called hybrid warfare combining cyber-attacks with traditional military activity in Georgia and Crimea. Media caption Experts have been warning for years it is a matter of when - rather than if - hackers will kill somebody The EU and Ukraine blamed Russia after thousands of people in multiple cities in Ukraine experienced power cuts in 2015 and 2016 when hackers temporarily shut off electricity substations. The US UK and EU also blamed it for the hugely disruptive NotPetya wiper attack. Experts say about 2000 NotPetya attacks were launched in 2017 mainly aimed at Ukraine but the malicious software spread globally causing billions of dollars of damage to computer systems across Europe Asia and the Americas. Moscow denies being behind the attack calling such claims Russophobic. Related Topics Computer hacking Russia Cyber-attacks Ukraine]

Brexit: UK and EU will find 'durable' solutions to protocol,"Officials say there is a determination that outstanding issues are addressed and ""solutions found"".",Brexit: UK and EU will find durable solutions to protocol By John Campbell BBC News NI Economics & Business Editor Published 21 February comments Comments Share Related Topics EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks IMAGE SOURCE JOHANNA GERON/REUTERS Image caption British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commissioner in charge of Brexit negotiations Maroš Šefčovič pose for a photograph in Brussels Negotiations on the Northern Ireland Protocol will continue the EU and UKs lead negotiators have said. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commission Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič released a joint statement after Mondays talks in Brussels. They said there is a determination that outstanding issues are addressed. They are keen that durable solutions are found for the benefit of citizens businesses and stability in NI. Their officials have been engaged in technical talks since October. A senior EU official has suggested that the talks will happen in a more discreet way due to the forthcoming Northern Ireland elections. They said it could mean less regular formal political meetings which create a bit of expectation or excitement. IMAGE SOURCE JOHANNA GERON/REUTERS Image caption Maroš Šefčovič speaks during a news conference after a meeting the UK foreign secretary The statement from Mrs Truss and Mr Šefčovič noted that: The joint bodies established by the Withdrawal Agreement should meet regularly and agreed to discuss any point raised by the EU or the UK that is of relevance to the Withdrawal Agreement in general. The protocol is the Brexit deal which prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EUs single market for goods. That also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? The EU accepts that is causing difficulties for businesses and in October proposed a package of measures to reduce its practical impacts. In December it published further proposals aimed at guaranteeing the supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The UK wants more far-reaching changes to the protocols operation and governance. The EU official said that the technical talks had made some progress in trying to find ways to reduce the burden of customs paperwork on Northern Ireland businesses. The EU believes it will be possible to reduce the data fields on customs declarations from 80 to 30. The UK believes that the reduction should be greater with traders only needing to use customs codes which would describe goods in high level terms. But the EU says that for the purposes of risk management they need customs codes which give a greater level of detail. The example they give is olive oil - some types of olive oil like extra virgin are clearly for consumption in restaurants or supermarkets. IMAGE SOURCE HENRY NICHOLLS Image caption Liz Truss says a solution must be found to allow focus on external issues like the situation in Eastern Europe But other grades of olive oil are used for food processing - the EU believes a risk assessment needs to be able to draw that distinction which is why they want more detailed codes. There has also been progress on access to UK customs databases - long requested by the EU; their experts have got access and are beginning to understand how they might extract the data they need. However there appears to have been little progress on the issue of agri-food checks on goods moving from GB to NI. Asked if the UK would trigger Article 16 which allows either side to unilaterally decide whether to stop implementing parts of the trade deal Mrs Truss said that she wanted to improve the situation through talks. Article 16 is in the Protocol as a safeguard if things aren\t working as they should she said after the talks. Laser focus Mr Sefcovic told a news conference in Brussels that the intensified negotiations on the protocol had produced neither a breakthrough nor a breakdown. He said hard work would continue with a laser focus on practical solutions. My objective remains the same - to provide Northern Ireland and all stakeholders on the ground with stability predictability and opportunities stemming from the protocol he said. Ultimately this is the only way to protect the hard-earned gains of the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement in all its dimensions while avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland and minimising disruptions caused by Brexit without compromising the integrity of the EU\s single market he added. Northern Irelands first and deputy first ministers normally attend the Joint Committee but those positions are vacant since the Democratic Unionist Partys (DUP) Paul Givan stepped down from the first ministers post. He resigned as part of the DUPs campaign of opposition to the protocol. Sinn Féin Junior Minister Declan Kearney did attend in their absence. Meanwhile the Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi was asked on Monday about the possibility of any future trade deals between the UK and the United States. Ms Pelosi said: Our relationship in trade is dependent on how the Brexit accords are resolved. She added she wanted to see the Good Friday accords honoured and for the] border to remain the way it is. She said she had told Boris Johnson months ago not to expect a bilateral trade agreement with the US if there is an unravelling of the Good Friday accords in relationship to the border.]

Man who sent Marcus Rashford racist Euro 2020 final tweet jailed,"Justin Lee Price tweeted a ""clearly racist"" message to Marcus Rashford after the Euro 2020 final.",Man who sent Marcus Rashford racist Euro 2020 final tweet jailed Published 3 days ago Share IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Rashford was targeted with abuse online after the final and a mural honouring him was also defaced A man who racially abused Marcus Rashford on Twitter after the striker missed a penalty in Englands Euro 2020 final shoot-out defeat has been jailed. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Justin Lee Price sent a clearly racist tweet to the Manchester United player after the loss in July 2021. The 19-year-old\s actions constituted a hate crime a CPS spokesman said. Price of Grandison Gardens Worcester was jailed for six weeks at Kidderminster Magistrates Court. He previously admitted one count of sending a grossly offensive message by a public communication network at a hearing on 17 March. Ruin the game The CPS said Price initially tried to avoid detection by changing his Twitter username after the post was reported. He then denied the offence in his first police interview following his arrest but later admitted posting the tweet when he was questioned by officers a second time. The spokesman said the tweet which included Rashford\s username saw Price swear use a racist slur and claim that his dead nan could have scored that. IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Bukayo Saka who missed Englands last penalty also faced abuse online after the final Rashford and fellow players Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were targeted with abuse online in the aftermath of the final. A mural honouring Rashford was also defaced in Manchester before being repainted and covered with messages of hope and support. Speaking after sentencing senior crown prosecutor Mark Johnson said Price had targeted Rashford based on the colour of his skin and his action was clearly racist and a hate crime. Those who racially abuse footballers ruin the game for all he said. I hope this case sends out the message that we will not tolerate racism and offenders will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

Brexit: UK and EU to continue 'intensive' NI protocol talks,"The UK and EU agree on the ""need for progress in the interest of people in Northern Ireland"".",Brexit: UK and EU to continue intensive NI protocol talks By Jayne McCormack BBC News NI political correspondent Published 11 February comments Comments Share Related Topics EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks IMAGE SOURCE SIMON DAWSON / NO10 DOWNING STRE Image caption Liz Truss and Maroš Šefčovič met at Carlton Gardens in London on Friday The UK and EU will hold intensive discussions in the coming days after another round of negotiations between Liz Truss and her EU counterpart Maroš Šefčovič came to an end on Friday. The chief Brexit negotiator previously said fixing the Northern Ireland Protocol was an absolute priority. A joint statement indicated the pair had agreed on the need for progress in the interest of people in NI. They said they will keep in close touch. The UK foreign secretary and EU Commission vice president spoke via video-conference last week but no breakthrough was reached. A meeting of the Joint Committee the formal body overseeing the protocol will happen on 21 February. That will be the first such meeting of the committee in more than six months. The government has insisted it wants to reach a solution urgently after the collapse of the power-sharing executive at Stormont last week. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) withdrew Paul Givan as first minister as part of its ongoing opposition to the Irish Sea border. The party has argued that unless the arrangements are changed political institutions in Northern Ireland cannot continue as normal. Image caption Liz Truss said she wants to work with the EU towards solutions that deliver for people in Northern Ireland Ahead of the meeting Ms Truss said: Fixing the Northern Ireland Protocol is an absolute priority for me. We have a shared responsibility with the EU to work towards solutions as quickly as possible that deliver for the people of Northern Ireland. The protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EUs single market for goods and EU customs rules are enforced at its ports. That arrangement has prevented a hardening of the Irish land border but it means new paperwork and processes when importing goods from Great Britain. Unionist politicians have criticised the arrangements and say the Irish Sea border undermines Northern Irelands position in the UK as well as causing difficulties for some businesses. It is slow-going The fact that a statement is joint would usually be taken as a good sign. But todays readout from the UKs Liz Truss and the EUs Maroš Šefčovič was also very brief - with a good chunk of the word count used up describing the logistics of the meeting rather than its actual substance. Rumours that the UK would use today to make a big new offer have been downplayed by both sides although I am told ideas are always being batted about. Customs is the area where there has been the most progress but it is slow-going. All eyes now turn to the joint committee on 21 February - where senior politicians and representatives will meet in Brussels. It is a moment to take stock and see what if anything can be formally agreed in this period of heightened political sensitivity in Northern Ireland ahead of the assembly elections in May. Greatest threat Speaking after an anti-protocol rally in Dromore County Down on Thursday night DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said it was the single greatest threat to Northern Ireland\s place in the UK in a generation. The presence of trade barriers within our own country has the grave potential to succeed where decades of terrorism failed by driving an irrevocable wedge between Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK Sir Jeffrey said. IMAGE SOURCE PACEMAKER PRESS Image caption Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the EU should act immediately to resolve the problems created by the protocol If the EU really care about political stability in Northern Ireland then they should act immediately to resolve the problems created by the protocol. The rally also featured TUV leader Jim Allister and Ulster Unionist assembly member Robbie Butler alongside Baroness Kate Hoey and former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib. On Thursday former prime minister John Major described the protocol as arguably one of the worst pieces of negotiation we have seen in recent history. It is causing an enormous amount of trouble he said. Whether anyone deliberately misled about that I can\t say - certainly they were mistaken. But it does help if you sign treaties if you understand them before you sign them. IMAGE SOURCE PA MEDIA Image caption Former prime minister John Major described the protocol as arguably one of the worst pieces of negotiation we have seen in recent history On Wednesday Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated his view that the government would trigger a mechanism to override part of the deal if a breakthrough cannot be reached. Article 16 allows either the UK or EU to temporarily suspend the protocol if it is deemed to be causing significant economic societal or environmental difficulties. Givan resignation triggers fresh political crisis Executive return difficult if protocol remains A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Over the past seven months the UK government has been attempting to renegotiate the deal. In July it proposed an arrangement in which goods from Great Britain which are due to stay in Northern Ireland would not be checked and would have minimal paperwork. Goods which are due to move onwards to the Republic of Ireland would be checked at Northern Irelands ports. The EU published its own proposals in October which it said would significantly reduce but not eliminate checks on goods. It has previously said that the easiest way to reduce checks would be for the UK to sign up to a Swiss-style agri-food agreement. That would involve all of the UK following the relevant EU rules something the government has said it could not accept.]

Climate change: EU moves to label nuclear and gas as sustainable despite internal row,"A highly controversial decision to class nuclear and gas power as ""green"" splits EU members.",Climate change: EU moves to label nuclear and gas as sustainable despite internal row Published 2 February Share Related Topics Climate change IMAGE SOURCE REUTERS Image caption Only some EU members use nuclear power - others are fiercely opposed Nuclear and natural gas energy plants could be counted as green energy under controversial EU plans just unveiled. The European Commission says it has decided that both types of energy can classify as sustainable investment if they meet certain targets. But the move has divided the EU and been fiercely opposed by some members. Austria\s chancellor responded to the news by saying nuclear power is neither green nor sustainable. I cannot understand the decision of the EU Karl Nehammer said. He said he would back his environment minister Leonore Gewessler in pursuing legal action at the European Court of Justice if the plans go ahead. This decision is wrong Ms Gewessler said. The EU Commission today agreed its greenwashing programme for nuclear energy and the fossil fuel] natural gas. Luxembourg has also said it will join in legal action. The EU has set itself a goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050 and the Commission argues that to get there a great deal of private investment is needed. Its proposals are meant to guide investors. 🇱🇺 strongly reaffirms its opposition to the inclusion of #nuclear & fossil #gas in the decision on #EUTaxonomy for sustainable finance of the @EUCommission. We will consider further legal steps together with 🇦🇹. @TimmermansEU @McGuinnessEU @KadriSimson @DieschbourgC @MinFinLux — Claude Turmes (@ClaudeTurmes) February 2 2022 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter Spain too has strongly objected to the idea which was debated for months before being formally proposed on Wednesday. But those objections are balanced by support from nuclear-using nations such as France. Nuclear energy involves fewer carbon emissions but has different safety concerns and requires disposal of dangerous waste. Classifying natural gas as sustainable also has supporters who argue that some countries which still rely on coal for energy - such as Poland - would benefit from incentives to move to a relatively cleaner supply. Germany a powerful country in EU politics relies heavily on gas in its own energy mix though its environment minister Steffi Lemke has criticised the plans. Battle ahead EU officials were keen to stress that the change was not a requirement for any state or company to invest in gas or nuclear. It is instead a highly technical set of rules called the EU Taxonomy about what classifies as sustainable so that private investors can decide where to put funds the commission says. It also regulates what can be said to be environmentally friendly so that climate-conscious investors can make informed decisions. The list is supposed to recognise green projects that make a substantial contribution to at least one of the EU\s environmental goals while not significantly harming any of them. A really simple guide to climate change Greenhouse gas build-up hit new high in 2020 Fossil fuel production set to soar in next decade Commission officials point to the strict limits on what qualifies. For example natural gas generation is under a strict CO2 emissions limit and a requirement to switch to low-carbon gas by 2035. Nuclear power meanwhile must be in countries with clear plans and funding for dealing with nuclear waste. Critics however have accused the EU of so-called greenwashing - precisely what it says its classification system is supposed to avoid. But the decision to label both controversial industries as green is not yet final. In addition to the threat of legal action from Austria and Luxembourg the European Parliament and the council of heads of state have four months to consider the suggestion and object to it. IMAGE SOURCE EPA Image caption Commissioner Mairead McGuinness argues that every tool to reach climate targets must be used The bar is however relatively high. In order to block the commissions proposed plans either a majority of parliament members or at least 20 of the 27 national leaders are needed. Green parties which together with independents and others form one of the main power blocs in the European Parliament are fiercely campaigning against the plan. But European Commissioner Mairead McGuinness said we need to use all the tools at our disposal to reach the climate-neutral target. Private investment was key she said and the proposals were setting out strict conditions to help mobilise finance to support this transition away from more harmful energy sources like coal.
